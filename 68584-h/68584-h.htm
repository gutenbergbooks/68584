<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
<i>ATTACKED BY ROBBERS.</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Your money or your life!  Quick!  Your
money or your life!"
</p>

<p>
Cyril Morton gave a cry of horror and
alarm.  A masked brigand was pointing a revolver
at his father, whose pale face confronted it with
unnatural calmness.
</p>

<p>
Cyril had never passed through such a terrible
minute in his whole life as that one during which
his father remained silent, instead of replying to his
fierce assailant's demand.  A short while before
the train-boy, passing down the outside passage of
the comfortable American train, bearing his tray
of chocolate, biscuits, fruit, etc., had waited on them
and promised to return in a few minutes with illustrated
papers wherewith to beguile the tedium of
the journey.  The train, which was a very slow one,
was going from Menominee northwards.  Cyril and
his father had come to North America in search of
the latter's brother, now long absent from his home.
When last heard of Gerald Morton was in Michigan,
so to that State they came on the death of Cyril's
mother, whose last request was that her husband
should go and look up his only brother.  Cyril was
twelve years old; he was an only child, and his
father, in his sorrow, could not bear the thought of
leaving him behind in England, so the two travelled
together and were "chums," as the boy called it.
After a delightful sail from Chicago over the calm
grey waters of Lake Michigan they were enjoying
their slow journey through immense pine forests,
when suddenly a band of robbers galloped up to
the train, flung themselves from their horses, and
clambered on to it.  First they struck down the
engine-driver, reversed the engine, and stopped the
train.  Then they began to search the passengers,
demanding of all their money or their life.
</p>

<p>
On receiving no answer the ruffian who was
threatening Mr. Morton repeated his words in a
voice of thunder.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father," cried Cyril, "give him the money, or
he will kill you!  Father, <i>please</i>."  He screamed the
last words in his agony of apprehension.
</p>

<p>
His attention being diverted by the boy the
man glanced aside at him, and in that moment
Mr. Morton, with a sudden movement, wrested the
pistol from his grasp.
</p>

<p>
The other instantly snatched at it, and a struggle
commenced between the two men for its possession.
Backwards and forwards they swayed, now locked
in each other's arms, now flung apart.  Once the
revolver fell upon the soft-cushioned seat, when
Cyril instantly caught hold of it, and, watching
his opportunity, slipped it back into his father's
hand.
</p>

<p>
Maddened with rage the brigand struck the boy
down with his huge fist.  Then Cyril lay like a log
upon the floor of the carriage, and knew no
more.
</p>

<p>
A few moments and the struggle between the
men was ended by the brigand's firing point-blank
at Mr. Morton, who fell back on the seat apparently
lifeless.
</p>

<p>
The robber proceeded to rapidly search his victim.
Quickly he pocketed a gold watch and chain, a
well-filled purse, and also a pocket-book containing notes.
Then he stooped over the boy, looking in his pockets.
As he did so something in the white upturned face
touched even his hard heart.
</p>

<p>
"He's not unlike my Harry," he muttered, thrusting
back the little purse his fingers had just closed
on.  "No, I'll not take his money.  He'll come to,
and maybe want it."
</p>

<p>
Turning away he went on to rob someone else;
and presently, with his pockets full of notes and
gold, returned to his first victims, still lying where
he had left them.
</p>

<p>
The other outlaws were leaving the train and
mounting their horses; they were all in a hurry to
get away.
</p>

<p>
The man who had struck down poor Cyril stood
over him now, with a softened look in his hard face
as he felt anxiously for the boy's pulse.
</p>

<p>
"Living!" he exclaimed, when his rough fingers
had found it.  "Well, he's a plucky little lad.  I'll
take him with me.  His father's dead," he added,
glancing at him.  "I'll adopt the lad.  He shall be
my son, instead of poor Harry."  So saying he
lifted Cyril in his arms, carried him to where he
had left his horse, and when he rode off with the
others the boy, still unconscious, was on the saddle
before him, his curly head drooping against his
shoulder.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-010"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-010.jpg" alt="&quot;The boy was on the saddle before him.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;The boy was on the saddle before him.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Now it happened that under the double burden
the brigand's horse lagged behind the others, and
although its master whipped and spurred it cruelly
it could not keep up with them.
</p>

<p>
"Whiterock," cried the captain of the band more
than once, "come on.  Why do you linger?"
</p>

<p>
"Coming, sir," answered Whiterock, redoubling his
efforts, but in vain.
</p>

<p>
At last the captain, turning in anger to see why
he was disobeyed, perceived the boy, and cried
impatiently&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What have you got there?  A lad?  Ridiculous!
Absurd!  Fling him down.  Leave him.
We want no babies."
</p>

<p>
Outlaw though he was&mdash;strong, desperate too&mdash;the
brigand dared not disobey his chief.  Reluctantly,
therefore, he stopped short, sprang off his
horse, and lifted the boy down in his arms.  Muttering
that he had once a son like him he laid Cyril
down under a forest tree, and then, turning quickly,
remounted his horse and rode rapidly after his
captain.
</p>

<p>
All the horsemen rode away.  The sound of their
horses' hoofs died out in the distance.
</p>

<p>
Presently, as evening drew on, a huge grey bear,
stealing through the bushes, stood looking down on
the unconscious boy.  After a few minutes the bear
stooped, and almost poked him with his nose.
</p>

<p>
If Cyril had awoke then, if he had moved one
hand, or in any way "shown fight," it would have
been all over with him.  Unless very hungry,
however, these North American bears do not attack
human beings if they make no aggressive movement;
so Cyril remaining perfectly still the bear,
having satisfied his curiosity, moved slowly away.
</p>

<p>
The shades of night stole over the forest.  It
became quite dark.  The wild beasts sought their
prey.  All sorts of dangers were on every side; but,
quite unconscious still, the boy lay there, a faint
stirring of his pulse alone showing that life was still
within his slight young frame.
</p>

<p>
He had no mother at home praying for him, but
it might be in the Paradise above she was pleading
for her boy, over whom a merciful Providence was
watching.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
<i>ALONE IN THE FOREST.</i>
</h3>

<p>
About midday Cyril came to himself,
opening wondering eyes upon an
unknown world.  Where was he?  What
had happened?  Where was his father?  Why
were his limbs when he tried to move them so
stiff and cramped?  Raising himself with difficulty
he leaned upon one elbow, and looked round
searchingly.
</p>

<p>
He was alone in these unknown wilds.  Where
was his father?  Why had he left him?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the boy gave a great cry; he remembered
all.  His father was killed, must have been
killed, or he would never have parted from him.  He
had put the pistol in his father's hand before the
robber struck him; he did not know what had
happened after that.  But he felt convinced that his
father was dead, and he lay down again upon the
ground, crying as if his heart would break.  There
was a very tender love between him and his father;
since the mother's death they had been all in all
to one another.  But a new thought came to Cyril
by-and-by, and that was that someone must have
brought him to the place where he was lying.  For
there was no railway line to be seen near there;
indeed, the trees grew too thickly to admit of such
a possibility.  Who, then, had brought him away
from the train, away from the railway line?  Was
it, could it possibly have been his father?  But if so,
where was he now?
</p>

<p>
Animated by the hope of finding him Cyril
struggled to his feet.  Then he called as loudly
as he could, which was not very loud, for his
throat was parched and dry, and he himself felt
very faint.  "Father!  Father!" he cried.  "Father,
where are you?  Father, speak; tell me you are
here!  Father!  Father!"
</p>

<p>
But there was no answer.
</p>

<p>
Despairingly the boy turned in first one direction
and then another, repeating his cries until he could
not utter another word.  But all in vain.  There was
no trace of a human being in any direction.  He
was alone, quite alone in the forest.
</p>

<p>
In silence now he wandered up and down, finding
some wild raspberries, or what looked like them, and
eating them quite ravenously.  The soft fruit allayed
his thirst, and then he could shout again, which he
did repeatedly.  At first it had been his intention
to remain near the place where he had been lying,
that if his father or whoever brought him there
returned he might be found.  But he lost his way
very soon and could not find the place again.
</p>

<p>
"Father!  Father!  Help!  help!" he cried, pushing
his way through the long grass and bushes, and
running along narrow tracks in first one direction
and then another.  "Oh, help, I am perishing!  Save
me!"
</p>

<p>
For now a despairing feeling came over him that
help would never come, that he would wander up
and down there until he died&mdash;perhaps killed by
some wild beast.  He knew there were bears in
that part of America, and presently he came across
a young one.  It did not appear to see him, and
he ran away from its neighbourhood as fast as he
could.  He had no weapon of any kind, and the
thought of that made him presently get out his
pocket-knife and cut himself a stout stick.  Then
it was that he discovered that after all he had not
been robbed.  His purse was still in his pocket.  He
took it out, opened it, and examined its contents
ruefully.  One piece of gold, a sovereign, and a good
many shillings and sixpences were all there.  But
of what use was money to him now?  How gladly,
thankfully, he would give the whole of his money
to anyone who would show him the way out of that
fearful solitude!  However, he was in a place where
money availed not.  What could he do?  He was in
despair.
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered his heavenly Father, and,
kneeling down just where he was in the lonely
forest, he prayed to Him for help and guidance,
and especially that, if his father still lived, they
two might speedily find each other.
</p>

<p>
He felt somewhat comforted when, at length, he
rose from his knees, for he knew that he had done
the very best thing he could for himself and his dear
father by laying all their concerns before God in
prayer.
</p>

<p>
Looking round for more berries he soon found
some, ate, and was again refreshed.  Then he walked
on once more in the hope that he would get to
some inhabited place.  But he was very tired; and
presently, when his foot slipped over a tree-root
and he fell heavily to the ground, he did not feel
able to rise again.  He therefore lay still where he
was, and soon fell fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
Again the shades of night crept over the tall trees
of the forest, veiling them and the sleeping boy in
darkness.  And once again the beasts of prey stole
forth in search of food, but did not come near Cyril
to harm him, whilst, unconscious of his danger, he
slept on.
</p>

<p>
He was happy now, for he was dreaming of his
mother.  She looked as sweet as ever and far
happier, for the lines of pain and trouble on her
face had been all smoothed away.  "Cyril, my boy,"
she said to him, stooping to kiss his brow, "it was
brave of you to help your father as you did yesterday.
You suffered for it.  Yes, but that is all over.
Now you must be brave in searching for your father
and waiting patiently until God, in His good
providence, permits you both to meet again."
</p>

<p>
"I will, I will, mother," Cyril cried in his dream;
and then it ceased, and he lay in heavy, dreamless
slumber until he awoke with a consciousness of its
being very hot, and that there was a strong smell
of something burning.
</p>

<p>
Starting up and looking round he found that it
was morning, and that away to the right of him
there was a mighty cloud of smoke mingled with
flames, out of which great showers of sparks flew
up into the sky.  A tremendous roaring as of
thunder announced the burning of great forest
trees.  The noise of it almost drowned the pitiful
cries and screams, roars and screeches of wild
animals and birds as, in their flight for their lives,
the cruel flames caught hold of them and burnt them.
</p>

<p>
"The forest is on fire!" cried Cyril aloud in
terror-stricken accents, "and I, where shall I go?  Oh,
God," he murmured, "help me!" and set off running
fast in the opposite direction from that in which the
fire was advancing.
</p>

<p>
The air had become exceedingly hot.  It dried
up everything before the fire, so that when the
flames came up they caught hold of the great pine
trees without a moment's loss.  The very ground
seemed scorched.
</p>

<p>
Cyril found the fire gaining upon him.  Of what
use was it to run?  Oh, if he could only come to
some open space, or a sheet of water into which he
could hasten!
</p>

<p>
But no.  There were no signs of either.  Cyril
became hotter and hotter.  Soon, very soon, the fire
would overtake him.  He almost felt its hot breath
on his cheeks.  Wringing his hands he sank down
with a loud, despairing cry.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
<i>RESCUED.</i>
</h3>

<p>
Now it happened that Whiterock and his
companions had been fleeing before the
fire for at least an hour, when its direction
brought them to the place where Cyril fell.
</p>

<p>
The boy's wild, despairing cry was unheeded by
most of the men, who were only bent on saving
their own lives, but on Whiterock's ears it fell with
powerful appeal.  Swiftly he galloped up, espied
the boy, leaped from his horse, flung Cyril upon
the saddle, remounted, and once more rode off
with him at full speed.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-021"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-021.jpg" alt="&quot;The boy's wild, despairing cry was unheeded.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;The boy's wild, despairing cry was unheeded.&quot;
</p>

<p>
The men knew of a large clearing extending for
several miles, where lumbermen had felled and
carried away the great pines.  They rode straight
there, and in the course of an hour reached the
place.
</p>

<p>
There was no fear of any fire following them
into the clearing, for nothing remained there upon
which it could feed.  It took another direction,
more to the north-west, and the men and boy
were safe.
</p>

<p>
With noisy jests and much jeering at the fears
which now were over the company made their
way to the deserted camp of the lumberers.  This
proved to be a big frame-building, run up for the
temporary convenience of the men who felled the
trees, and then deserted when their work was done
and the timber conveyed away.  All round the
inside of the building were sleeping-bunks, half
filled still with dry grass and ferns.
</p>

<p>
They set to work with alacrity to kindle a fire,
make coffee, cook some meat, and spread out their
biscuits.
</p>

<p>
No one took any notice of Cyril, who stood in
a corner watching them furtively.  What powerful
men they were!  And how wicked some of them
looked!  But others seemed quite pleasant and kind.
He watched Whiterock closely with very mingled
feelings.  He would have been most grateful to
him for saving his life if it were not for the strong
suspicion he had that he was the very man who
had attacked his father.  At that time he wore a
mask.  Now his dark-bearded face was uncovered.
But there was something in his build and manner,
and especially in the tones of his voice, which made
Cyril confident that he was his poor father's assailant.
How the boy longed to ask him if he had left his
father living still!  Would he be very angry if he
were asked the question?
</p>

<p>
"Whiterock!" Cyril called timidly to him, stealing
nearer as he did so.
</p>

<p>
The man had constituted himself cook, and was
stooping over a battered frying-pan, whereon
spluttered great slices of meat.  Being much absorbed
in his cooking he only noticed Cyril's call by giving
him a nod.
</p>

<p>
Cyril did not return the nod.  For just as he
was about to do so it occurred to him that if the
man were really his poor father's cruel assailant he
could return no greeting of his.
</p>

<p>
Whiterock did not notice the boy's lack of
cordiality; he was talking to one of the stewards now
about the meat, which had run short.  There would
not be sufficient to go round.  This was a great
difficulty which could not be got over by talking.
</p>

<p>
When at last the men sat and lay down in a
sort of circle round the stewards, who helped out
the food straight from two central dishes into the
men's hands, Cyril was called up by Whiterock and
received a share of biscuit only.
</p>

<p>
"Biscuit is good enough for bairns," said the
steward, laughing.
</p>

<p>
But Whiterock, grumbling, thrust a small piece
of meat upon the boy's biscuit.  It was his own.
But how could Cyril eat it?  He pushed it back
into the man's hand.  Whiterock looked annoyed,
and made no further attempt to improve his meal.
The men drank their coffee out of little cups
belonging to their flasks.  Cyril had not one, so would
have had to go without if the steward had not
kindly lent him his.
</p>

<p>
After the breakfast all the men but two or three,
who remained to look after the horses, collect wood,
and so forth, went off on foot to hunt.  They returned,
late in the afternoon, with an immense quantity of
game.  The men who had not been hunting were
sent, with a couple of horses, to fetch home some
of the best parts of the deer which the others had
shot.
</p>

<p>
There was a great feast that evening, and much
work afterwards in cutting and hanging up strips
of meat to be smoked and dried by the fire during
the night.  Then the men divided the sleeping-bunks.
Cyril shared one with Whiterock.
</p>

<p>
"There, get in, youngster," said Whiterock.  "I'm
awful sleepy.  Want to say something?  No, I can't
hear it to-night.  To-morrow some time will do.
Good-night."  He fell asleep, or appeared to do so,
almost as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
Cyril dared not disturb him to inquire about his
father's fate.  He, too, was very sleepy, and in spite
of his anxiety speedily followed his companion's
example.
</p>

<p>
He was awoke suddenly in the night by shouts
from the men, and then much loud talking and
exclaiming.  What was the matter?  The men were
flying wildly out of their bunks, on all sides, and
making for the door.  At that moment something
soft, smooth, and slippery wound itself round Cyril's
neck.  With a cry for help he caught hold of
Whiterock's hand.
</p>

<p>
The man sat up and astonished the boy by
laughing loudly.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
<i>TEMPTED.</i>
</h3>

<p>
Whiterock flung something from the
boy, and, jumping out of the bunk,
still laughing loudly, lifted him on to
the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Captain," he called out, "these old bunks here
are full of pine-snakes, which have crawled into
them for warmth.  Fortunately they are quite
harmless.  Now then, men, they won't hurt you!"
</p>

<p>
When all the men had returned they declared that
it was impossible to sleep any more that night.  So
more coffee was made, and they all sat and lay about
near the fire, talking of their future plans.  Cyril
began to count the men, but was still so sleepy
that he could not quite decide whether their number
was nearer twenty than thirty.
</p>

<p>
For some time no one took any notice of the boy.
But at last the Captain did so, and jeered at
Whiterock for turning nursemaid.
</p>

<p>
Then they all began to talk of Cyril, much to his
discomfiture.
</p>

<p>
Presently Whiterock asked him if he would like
to remain with them as his adopted son, and in
time would become one of the band.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, like Wolfgang," said the Captain, stroking
his long beard.  "He was a lad of about your age.
We found him.  I won't say where, but he grew
up amongst us, and for cleverness and pluck there
wasn't a man of us all that could beat him.  Ah,
he would have been captain if he had lived!  He
was killed in a scuffle with the police.  He died
fighting nobly."
</p>

<p>
Cyril had his own opinion about the nobleness of
fighting the public officers of law and order.  But
he felt sorry for Wolfgang.  The lad probably knew
no better.
</p>

<p>
"Well, little 'un," said Whiterock, "would you like
to stay with us and be my boy?"
</p>

<p>
"But my father?" said Cyril tremulously, looking
appealingly at him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's dead," said Whiterock hastily.  "Now
come, boy, don't make a scene."
</p>

<p>
Cyril turned his back on him.  He was struggling
with all his might to keep back the tears which
would not be suppressed.  His father, his dear, kind
father, slain by that coarse, ruffianly fellow!  Oh, it
was too cruel!
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" demanded the Captain.
</p>

<p>
Whiterock crossed over to him, and said something
rather low in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried the Captain.  "But that's only the
fortune of war.  Come here, my boy," he added to
Cyril.
</p>

<p>
Cyril went up to him with a pale, resolute face.
</p>

<p>
"Whiterock saved your life, lad," said the Captain.
"You must remember that.  There wasn't one of us
who would have done so much for you at such a
time."
</p>

<p>
"He took my father's life," replied Cyril, looking
up with flashing eyes, the hot blood mounting to
his very brow.
</p>

<p>
"But he saved <i>your</i> life, lad," remonstrated the
Captain.
</p>

<p>
"I know he saved my life," cried Cyril, "and I
just wish he hadn't!  As he killed my father, I
would rather have died than&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet!" thundered the Captain.  "Will you
stay with us or no?"
</p>

<p>
"No, a thousand times no!" answered the boy
boldly.
</p>

<p>
"I won't have him," muttered Whiterock sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"But I will," cried the Captain.  "Look here, my
lad, I honour you.  Yes, I honour you for loving
and respecting your father.  You're a plucky lad!
And if you like to stay with us you shall be my
adopted son.  Do you hear what I say?"
</p>

<p>
The men uttered various exclamations, tending
to show that what they considered "a piece of rare
luck" had come in Cyril's way.
</p>

<p>
Then they all waited for the boy's answer.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you, Captain," he said politely, "I
cannot."
</p>

<p>
"What for, lad?  Why not?" demanded the
Captain wrathfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, because '<i>Noblesse oblige</i>!'" replied the boy.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
Cyril repeated "<i>Noblesse oblige</i>" distinctly, in
tones which were heard all over the great room.
</p>

<p>
"How do you explain those words?" asked the
Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't you understand them?" said Cyril,
surprised that such a great man as the Captain
should be ignorant of their meaning.  "My father"&mdash;his
voice shook a little as he said the name&mdash;"told
me <i>Noblesse oblige</i> means rank imposes obligations,
and that much is expected from one in a
good position.  You see, Captain, <i>gentlemen can't
do mean, dishonourable things</i>.  I'm sorry to
disappoint you, but you see I come of a race of
honourable gentlemen who would scorn to rob and
plunder."
</p>

<p>
The Captain laughed loudly, rudely.  "What a
fine gentleman we've got here!" said he; "let's
look at him."  He dragged Cyril forward into the
middle of the room.  "There, my fine fellow, look
around you," cried he.  "Do you know several of
these men are gentlemen of birth and breeding?"
</p>

<p>
"Then they've forgotten it," said Cyril calmly.
</p>

<p>
A murmur of anger went round the room.  "Forgotten
what?" cried one man.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Noblesse oblige</i>," replied Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"Absurd," cried the Captain.  "Have you no
better reason than that for refusing my offer?"
</p>

<p>
Cyril was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Speak out," cried the Captain.
</p>

<p>
Slowly but bravely Cyril said that there was yet
another reason.  He could not join them because
he was a follower of Christ, who made the law of
love, saying, "<i>By this shall all men know that ye
are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>"
</p>

<p>
A cry of rage burst from most of the men
upon hearing this.  But one or two drew rough
hands across their faces, as if to hide them for a
moment.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
<i>CYRIL'S SENTENCE.</i>
</h3>

<p>
"You little prig!" sneered the Captain
of the band.  But he did not look
at Cyril.  "Preaching at us!" cried
another man indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"He wants taking down a peg or two," said a
third.
</p>

<p>
"What sinners we must be!" scoffed a fourth.
</p>

<p>
"Leave him alone," growled one whose heart the
boy's brave, noble words had touched.  "Let him
be."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, do," said a younger man.  But he spoke
timidly, looking down on the ground as he did so.
"In case&mdash;in case," he added, "the youngster may be
right."
</p>

<p>
"Right!  Hark at him!  Hark at Green!" jeered
two or three rough voices.
</p>

<p>
The Captain looked angrily around at the men,
and then at the boy.  He felt thoroughly out of
temper.
</p>

<p>
"A good thrashing would do the lad no harm,"
he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Thrashing's too good for him," grumbled Whiterock,
all his kind feeling for Cyril having changed to
bitter dislike.
</p>

<p>
"Boy, come here," cried the Captain.
</p>

<p>
Cyril went up to him.  He was very pale now,
and trembling.  He did not feel at all brave as he
clasped his hands nervously together.  It was terrible
to feel that he stood alone, unarmed, helpless in the
midst of all these men.
</p>

<p>
The Captain looked searchingly at him.  "Your
name, lad?" he demanded in stern tones.
</p>

<p>
"Cyril Morton," answered the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Cyril!  A girl's name!  Pooh!"
</p>

<p>
With a sudden change of mood the Captain
laughed derisively.  He passed his big, rough hand
over the boy's soft curly hair and down his slim
young figure.
</p>

<p>
"All the same," he said, "I like you, boy, and
believe that we can make a man of you yet.
After all, I will repeat my offer.  Will you stay
and be my son?"
</p>

<p>
Cyril shook his head.  He could not speak at the
moment, for the right words would not come.  Was
he to go through the ordeal again?
</p>

<p>
"He won't!" cried one of the men indignantly.
"Did you ever know such defiance?"
</p>

<p>
"Speak," demanded the Captain, his hand resting
heavily now on Cyril's shoulder as if he would
compel his obedience.  "Do you still refuse?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I cannot&mdash;oh, I cannot accept your offer!
I cannot!" cried the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," shouted the Captain angrily.  "You
defy us!  Here, you, Whiterock, you brought the
youngster.  Take him outside a bit while we decide
what is to be done.  Take him away, I say, for
ten minutes.  Then bring him back to hear his
sentence."
</p>

<p>
Cyril trembled.  Would they kill him?  Out here
in the backwoods they could do whatever they liked.
There were no policemen here.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," said Whiterock, seizing hold of Cyril's
collar and dragging him out of the place.
</p>

<p>
Outside he flung the boy down on the ground at
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Whiterock," pleaded Cyril, "though you killed
my father&mdash;my dear, good father, will you not save
me, his son?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-035"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-035.jpg" alt="&quot;Oh, Whiterock, will you not save me?&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Whiterock, will you not save me?&quot;
</p>

<p>
It was the best plea the boy could have made, for
since those words of his to the Captain, and his
terrible distress about his poor father, Whiterock
had felt something like compunction for what he
had done.
</p>

<p>
"The matter lies in your own hands, Cyril," he
said, not unkindly.  "You, and only you, can save
your life.  Accept the Captain's offer&mdash;it is a generous
one."
</p>

<p>
"But I can't," said Cyril.  "Oh, Whiterock, I
can't!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, come back with me inside."
</p>

<p>
"One moment," cried poor Cyril.  "What will they
do to me?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll hear that soon enough," muttered Whiterock,
leading him inside the huge shanty.
</p>

<p>
"Come here," called the Captain loudly, "and hear
our decision."
</p>

<p>
Cyril stood tremblingly before him.
</p>

<p>
"It is," cried the man, "that if you do not change
your mind by morning and consent to become one
of our band, we shall tie you to a bunk and leave
you here imprisoned in this camp, with only the
snakes for your companions."
</p>

<p>
A cry of horror escaped from Cyril's lips.  Then
eagerly, passionately, he pleaded with the Captain
to punish him in any other way he liked than
that.
</p>

<p>
But to all and everything he urged the Captain
had only one answer, Cyril must accept his offer, and
then all would be well with him.
</p>

<p>
The boy, however, although greatly tempted to
dissemble for a while and pretend to comply with
the Captain's wishes until they reached a more
civilised place where he might gain succour,
remained firm.
</p>

<p>
So did the Captain.  At the break of day
he and the men breakfasted without giving one
morsel of food to the boy.  Then they made their
preparations for leaving the place, which consisted
mainly in packing up the best of the game and
deer flesh.
</p>

<p>
When they were quite ready to start the Captain
strode up to Cyril, asking if he had changed his
mind.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," answered the boy.
</p>

<p>
Then the Captain made two of his men lay Cyril
down in a bunk and tie him to it securely.
</p>

<p>
The horrified boy, looking round nervously,
perceived a snake at the foot of the bunk, and another
larger reptile at one side of it.
</p>

<p>
Was he to be left exposed to their unwelcome
embraces?  Harmless they might be, but most
unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
Vainly he begged and implored for mercy.
</p>

<p>
To all and everything he said the Captain's reply
was always, "Do you change your mind?  Will you
be one of us?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot!  Oh, I cannot!" cried the poor boy
every time.
</p>

<p>
Last of all Whiterock came up, and once more
advised him not to throw his life away.
</p>

<p>
Cyril, however, would not yield.
</p>

<p>
Then they left him, and going outside mounted
their horses and rode off.
</p>

<p>
There was a great silence in the deserted camp.
</p>

<p>
Cyril prayed to God for help.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he felt a cold, slimy body slipping round
his leg and gliding up his waist.  He could not reach
it with his hands, which were tied to the side of the
bunk.  Shouting at it to frighten it away was not
of any use.
</p>

<p>
With a piercing scream he gave himself up for
lost and knew no more.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
<i>DELIVERANCE.</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Poor little chap!" said a rough but kindly
voice, as a young man unwound the
snake from Cyril's body and dashed it
on the ground.  "Pluckier than any of us men
after all.  Here, my lad, drink this."  Whilst
speaking he had unfastened Cyril's collar, and was now
holding a flask to his lips.
</p>

<p>
Opening his eyes Cyril looked with a troubled
gaze into the man's weather-beaten face.  What
had happened?  Slowly he remembered.  It was
the young man called Green, who had tried to
speak up for him when the others were so angry.
What was he doing here?
</p>

<p>
Green cut away the ropes, and lifting the boy out
of the bunk carried him away from the gloomy
place altogether into the sunshine outside.  Then
he laid him down on some long grass, and going
to his horse, which was tied to a fence near by,
got a packet of food out of his saddle-bag.
</p>

<p>
The sweet, fresh air revived Cyril; the sunshine
warmed him and did him good.  In his heart he
thanked God for the blessed change.
</p>

<p>
As Cyril ate and drank the repentant outlaw
watched him with hungry eyes.  There had been
a time once when he was an innocent boy like him.
Ah, well! that was long ago, and the good mother,
whose pride and joy he had been in those days,
had been dead for many years.  There was no one
to care so much what he did when she had gone,
and the tempter enticed him along the downward
path of idleness and self-pleasing.  He had forgotten
his mother's God, and had turned away his mind
from all thoughts of Him!  That was the beginning
and the end of all the evil.
</p>

<p>
But this boy, Cyril, had done very differently.
Alone, unarmed, he had been brave in the most
terrible danger, he had resisted the greatest
temptation.
</p>

<p>
The robber sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
Cyril, looking up, saw two great tears rolling
down the man's face.  He turned his head away
quickly lest the boy should see them.
</p>

<p>
Jumping up he threw his arms round the man's
neck.
</p>

<p>
"You have saved my life," he cried, "and now
you are in trouble yourself.  Yes, I know you are.
Is there anything I can do?  Will you&mdash;will you tell
me what is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
Deeply touched, Green sank down on the grass
beside Cyril and told him the whole story of his
life, from the time when, as a child, he said his
prayers at his mother's knee to the hour when, with
his companions, he heard Cyril's outspoken
condemnation of their wicked life.
</p>

<p>
"All night long," he said in conclusion&mdash;"all night
long I've been thinking, thinking as I never thought
before, and I've made up my mind, lad, that I'll
try to lead a different life.  If I can't earn my
bread and cheese in future&mdash;well, I'll go without
it.  And I'll ask God's forgiveness for all my
wrong-doing as long as I've breath in me to ask it."
</p>

<p>
After a pause, during which Green sat pondering,
his horse made an impatient movement, which
reminded him that they ought to set off.
</p>

<p>
"But where shall we go?" asked Cyril wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
Green replied that his father still lived, and
happened to be working in a great saw-mill not
twenty miles away from where they were.  "If we
go to him," he said, "I know he will get me work
to do."
</p>

<p>
Then Cyril asked if Green could put him in the
way of returning to England to his friends.
</p>

<p>
Green felt very sorry for him as he listened.  But
as Cyril had not nearly enough money, and he had
very little himself, he did not see how he could
possibly assist the boy to return home.  However,
the first thing was to get him into a place of safety,
for the robbers might return when they missed their
comrade, or possibly, relenting, they might come
back to liberate Cyril.
</p>

<p>
Mounting his horse, therefore, Green took up Cyril
before him on the saddle and rode off.
</p>

<p>
After proceeding about five miles through the
forest, without any greater adventure than the
frequent difficulty of finding a path through the dense
trees, they unfortunately came out into an open
sandy plain, across which they had not gone far
before they were perceived by some horsemen who
happened to be crossing the plain in another
direction.
</p>

<p>
With wild cries the men turned their horses about
and set off after Green and Cyril.
</p>

<p>
It was a most unequal chase.  The doubly-laden
horse could not by any chance escape the pursuers,
who gained ground every moment.
</p>

<p>
Encouraging it by word and by every other means
in his power Green rode on, but with little hope
in his heart.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer came the pursuers, laughing
and shouting as their horses flew over the plain.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Jack!  Jack, old fellow, for pity's sake!"
cried Green.
</p>

<p>
Tossing his head, with flakes of foam flying from
his mouth, the horse dashed on.
</p>

<p>
But still the followers gained a little more.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, old fellow!"  There was something despairing
now in Green's appeal to the animal.
</p>

<p>
Neighing loudly, as if in answer, the horse galloped
even faster than before.  His hoofs scarcely seemed
to touch the ground.  It was all Cyril could do to
hold on to his friend.
</p>

<p>
"Stop! stop! stop, or we fire!" cried a stentorian
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!"  Green's appeal was almost frantic now.
</p>

<p>
With a bound the horse responded, plunging
forward with greater speed than ever.
</p>

<p>
A shot rang through the air.  Jack swerved heavily
to one side; then he rolled over dead.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
<i>A FALSE ALARM.</i>
</h3>

<p>
The good horse Jack was dead, but neither
Green nor Cyril were hurt.  Fortunately
for them the last violent movement of the
animal threw them quite clear of its body.
</p>

<p>
"Cowards!" exclaimed Green, rising, and looking
indignantly through a cloud of dust in the direction
whence the shot had been fired.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-046"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-046.jpg" alt="&quot;'Cowards!' exclaimed Green, rising, and looking indignantly.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;'Cowards!' exclaimed Green, rising, and looking indignantly.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Why, Green!  Green!  They're off!" cried
Cyril, who was already on his feet.  "They're
off!"
</p>

<p>
"Off!  Leaving us!"
</p>

<p>
Green could scarcely believe his eyes.  Instead
of coming up to seize them the pursuers were
galloping away.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Look, look!" Cyril pointed in another
direction.
</p>

<p>
A little company of horsemen had entered the
sandy plain, and were riding rapidly towards
them.
</p>

<p>
"They've scared our enemies.  Aye, but we'd
better be off too," cried Green in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"But we needn't run away from these men," said
Cyril.  "They are our friends."
</p>

<p>
"Friends?  Not they!  I should have a bad time
of it if they caught me," said Green.  "You see,
they're Government men on the look-out for
train-robbers and horse-stealers.  Jack was a stolen
horse.  They'd make short work once they laid
hands on me.  Come on, lad."  He caught hold
of Cyril's hand and set off running back towards
the forest.
</p>

<p>
"But, Green, stop.  Let us tell them all.  You
are no outlaw now.  You can say you have done
with all that sort of thing&mdash;that you are repentant!"
protested Cyril as they ran.
</p>

<p>
"That would make no difference.  They'd punish
me for what I've done already."
</p>

<p>
Cyril could not help feeling that if he told his
story to these new-comers they would be sorry for
him, and would befriend him.  But he did not like
to suggest that he should separate from his
companion and wait for them.
</p>

<p>
Green, however, seemed to be thinking of it
"They would not believe even you," he said.  "You
see, you'd be found in my company, and they would
think you were one of us."
</p>

<p>
Across the boy's mind flashed the copybook
precept he had written many a time, "A man is
known by the company he keeps."  And he remembered
he could give no proof that his narrative
was true.
</p>

<p>
"It's impossible to keep this up," panted Green
after a while.  "I'm dead beat!  I can run no
further."
</p>

<p>
The perspiration poured down his red face; he
was thoroughly exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"Nor can I," cried Cyril, who, although more used
to running than Green, was not in his usual health.
"Let's give up."
</p>

<p>
They stopped short, and timidly, very timidly,
looked round.  They were alone.  Not a creature&mdash;neither
horse nor man&mdash;had followed them.  With
the exception of a few birds not a living thing could
they see.
</p>

<p>
"Why, wherever be they?" exclaimed Green.
</p>

<p>
"Where?  Where are they?" echoed Cyril.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.  Where, indeed, were their
pursuers?  Had the earth swallowed them?
</p>

<p>
"Something must have made the new-comers
fear to attack them after all," said Green.  "They
must have been as afraid of the others as
t'others was of them!  Did you ever know such
a thing?"
</p>

<p>
"And we've been just as bad," said Cyril in a
tone of disgust, "for we've been running away
from nobody at all!"  He sat down dejectedly on
a sandhill.
</p>

<p>
"Three parties all running away from each other,
without ever stopping to look round!  Well, that
was mighty queer," cried Green.
</p>

<p>
"You were wrong about them being men in pursuit
of you and your friends," said Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"I was indeed.  They weren't after us at all.  They
must have been just quiet, peaceable travellers who
heard the firing, and, being alarmed, made off back
again as fast as they could!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, they saved us, anyway," said Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's true enough."
</p>

<p>
"But how shall we get on without a horse?"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Jack!" sighed Green.  "Captain gave him
to me because I was the means of his getting a
whole lot&mdash;&mdash;" he stopped abruptly.  "What a
rascal I've been!" he reflected.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ravenously hungry," said Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"And we've left nearly all our food in the saddlebags.
But not quite, I've a little here!" Green got
a packet out of his pocket, and, opening it, disclosed
some slices of cooked meat.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you!" Cyril said, gratefully taking his
share.
</p>

<p>
For a few moments they ate in silence, then Green
said they must push ahead as fast as possible before
night came on.
</p>

<p>
"But which way shall we take?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we can't be so very far from the saw-mill
where my father works, if I could only find the way
there," said Green.
</p>

<p>
However, it turned out that he really did not
know where they were&mdash;so many turnings had confused
him.  But they could not remain there, and
so set off walking towards the forest.  In the shelter
of the trees, at least, they would not be so
conspicuous if the pursuers again came near.  Besides,
Green was certain the saw-mill, which he had once
been to, was near trees.
</p>

<p>
In an hour they found themselves again entering
the forest, and walking along a broad track made by
deer or other large animals.  It was dark below the
great pine trees, and before long the shades of
evening made it still darker.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Green, I can walk no further!" said Cyril at
length, sinking down at the foot of a tree.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think we're both about tired out,"
rejoined Green, leaning wearily against another tree,
and looking down compassionately on the tired boy.
"We'll stop here, lad, for the night."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But shall we be safe?  What about the
wild animals?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we must have a fire!  There's plenty of
dry wood about."
</p>

<p>
He went forward and began to heap up some
broken boughs.
</p>

<p>
"It won't do to light it here though," he went
on.  "We might set fire to the forest; everything
is so burnt up."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I can't go any further," said Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"No, you stay there.  I'll just take a look round."  He
walked off as he spoke, and disappeared amongst
the trees.
</p>

<p>
It was very still after he had gone.  The twittering
of birds and the occasional snarl of some wild
animal, or the breaking of twigs as one stealthily
approached, were the only sounds to be heard.  At
another time Cyril, who was unarmed, might have
been nervous had not bodily fatigue overcome every
other sensation.  As it was, by the time Green
returned to him he was fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
"Poor lad, I won't wake him," said the kindly
man, lifting Cyril in his strong arms, and carrying
him off as if he were a baby.
</p>

<p>
When Cyril awoke an hour later he saw a great
wood fire burning, and sending up showers of sparks
into the still night air.  He was lying in an open
space at one side of the fire, and Green was stooping
down near it, attending to the roasting of a bird.
</p>

<p>
"Supper's ready, my lad," he was calling.  "And
a blessing it is I've got some supper for you.  Jump
up."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  How did you get it, Green?" asked
Cyril eagerly, for all at once he felt uncommonly
hungry.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Green briefly, "you eat it."
</p>

<p>
He poked it out of the fire, and served it on a
smooth flat stone.  Then he divided it with his
pocket-knife, handing Cyril the best of it with the
same useful article.
</p>

<p>
The two made a good meal, for the food was very
welcome.  Then they lay down on the ground near
the fire and were soon fast asleep.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
<i>GREEN MEETS HIS FATHER.</i>
</h3>

<p>
It was scarcely light when Cyril was
awakened by Green shaking him vigorously.
</p>

<p>
"Wake up, lad.  Wake up!" he cried.  "There's
something queer near us!  Listen."
</p>

<p>
Cyril sat up, rubbing his eyes, and heard the
sound of horses galloping along, and then crashing
through the brushwood.  He saw strange lights
gleaming through the trees, and now shots were
fired, and loud and excited voices bewailed the
escape of some prey.
</p>

<p>
"Green," said the boy in a low tone, "are those
men after us again?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no.  It's some huntsmen.  I see now;
they're hunting deer with head-lights."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke one of the lights dashed through
the bushes up to them, and Cyril saw, to his
amazement, that it was a lighted lantern strapped on to
the head of a stout pony.  A man with a skin cap
on his head rode the pony.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" shouted he, "what's this?  What are
you fellows doing?  Camping out, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course we are," said Green cautiously.  "And
who may you be?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we're just a party of men from Ellison's
saw-mill&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ellison's saw-mill!  That's good hearing!" cried
Green.  "We're on our way there, but have got lost.
How far off are we now?"
</p>

<p>
"About six miles or so.  Where are your horses?"
</p>

<p>
Green looked embarrassed.  Then he said, "We
fell in with a rough lot&mdash;they shot our horse&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shot your horse?  Had you only <i>one</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Before Green could reply, much to his relief two
or three other men came up, who, after asking a
few questions, swung themselves from their saddles,
and, opening their saddle-bags, began to take out
sundry packages.
</p>

<p>
"We might as well have our breakfast here," said
one.  "Any objection to our using your fire to boil
our kettle, master?"
</p>

<p>
"None whatever.  Make yourselves at home,"
answered Green heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Any water hereabouts?" asked the man.
</p>

<p>
"There's a spring just round those trees, about
ten yards off."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  Fetch some, Jem.  We'll make coffee.
You and the lad will join us, stranger?"
</p>

<p>
"That's so," replied Green, "and thank you."
</p>

<p>
In a quarter of an hour the five huntsmen, Cyril,
and Green were partaking of a good breakfast,
consisting of coffee, tinned meat, and bread.
</p>

<p>
Cyril learnt from the men's talk that they had
been hunting all night and had shot two reindeer,
which some of their party had taken home, whilst
the others pressed on in search of more.  The light
of the lanterns fastened to their horses' heads
attracted the deer, who, on coming forward to look
at it, were shot point-blank by the men.
</p>

<p>
The boy thought it a very cruel way of entrapping
the beautiful creatures, but all the others said it was
"fine sport."
</p>

<p>
Presently the men, who had lingered too long
over their breakfast, jumped up, and mounting their
horses rode as fast as they could back towards the
mill.  Very little was said upon the way.  One of
the men took Cyril up behind him, and he found
it difficult enough to hold on to the saddle he
bestrode.  He had no strength left for talking.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by they arrived at their destination&mdash;a
group of houses and outbuildings, and a huge saw-mill,
with heaps of timber and roughly-hewn planks.
</p>

<p>
The master of the mill, who was a tall man, with
hair thickly sprinkled with grey, came to the door
of his office&mdash;a small building at one side of the
yard&mdash;as they rode up.
</p>

<p>
"Well, men?" he said laconically.
</p>

<p>
"We've killed two head of deer, that's all," replied
the spokesman of the party, "and we've picked up a
man and a boy who were on their way here."
</p>

<p>
"Dismount," said the master briefly, addressing
the strangers.
</p>

<p>
Green jumped down and took off his skin cap.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, Mr. Ellison, sir," said he, "but can
you tell me, is Josh Davidson, my father, still living
here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the master.  "You are his son
Ben?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," said Green, whose real name was
Ben Davidson.  "Can I see him?"
</p>

<p>
The master sent for the prodigal's father.  Then
looking at Ben, he said inquiringly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Turned over a new leaf?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Ben nodded.  His face was very red, and
great tears were in his eyes.  The man before whom
he stood knew all about him.  He knew of the
shameful years of robbery and violence; he knew
of the father's broken heart.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the saw-miller laid his hand on Ben's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Go meet him, lad," he said.  "See, he's crossing
the yard."
</p>

<p>
Ben hurried out.  The two in the office heard a
great glad cry&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My son!  My son!  'He was dead, and is alive
again.  He was lost, and is found!'  Thank God.
Oh, thank God!"
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Mr. Ellison to Cyril, "tell me who
you are.  Do you belong to that man?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; oh, no!"
</p>

<p>
"Then how came you to be here with him?"
</p>

<p>
Cyril looked up into the man's grave, kind face.
He wanted to tell him all that had befallen him
since the time that he sat by his father's side in
the train going northwards from Menominee, but
remembered that he must not betray the ex-robber.
And although it was evident Mr. Ellison knew
something of the latter's wrong-doing, Cyril was
not aware how far that knowledge extended.
</p>

<p>
A shade of sternness crept over Mr. Ellison's face
as he noticed the boy's hesitancy.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he said impatiently.
</p>

<p>
Cyril was greatly perplexed.  How much could
he tell the saw-miller without compromising the
man who had saved his life?
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
<i>AT THE SAW-MILL.</i>
</h3>

<p>
"It was in a train.  It was attacked by
rough, cruel men, and one of them killed
my father."
</p>

<p>
Cyril's voice shook as he spoke, and for a moment
he paused.
</p>

<p>
"I fell into the hands of the men, and they
were leaving me to die, when Green&mdash;I mean Ben
Davidson, rescued me."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Just so!  Well, I won't ask you questions
about that.  But say, what is your name?  Where
do you come from?"
</p>

<p>
"My name is Cyril Morton.  My father was an
English gentleman, with an estate in Cornwall.
We came to this country in search of my uncle,
Gerald Morton.  Have you ever known him, do
you think?"
</p>

<p>
Cyril asked the question with sudden eagerness.
Who was so likely as the great saw-miller to know
a sojourner in those parts?
</p>

<p>
The saw-miller shook his head.  "Ours is an
immense country," he said.  "Unless you have some
clue to his whereabouts I'm afraid you won't be
likely to find that uncle of yours, my boy."
</p>

<p>
"Then, if you please," said Cyril, "can you help
me to return to my friends in England?"
</p>

<p>
The saw-miller said nothing.  He looked
discouragingly at the boy.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said Cyril, "I've scarcely any money
with me.  But my father had plenty.  When I get
back to England I shall just go to Mr. Betts, our
lawyer, and get him to send your money back, with
interest&mdash;that is, if you will be so very kind as to
lend me some."
</p>

<p>
"Just so," said the saw-miller.  "But how can a
little chap like you travel all those thousands of
miles alone?  No, no, my boy, it's not so easily
done."
</p>

<p>
"But I must return home," protested Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course.  All in good time.  But you
must wait here until someone going to Chicago
comes this way."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;" began Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I can't argue with you, boy," said the
saw-miller shortly.  "You're very welcome to stay
here with us until it's convenient to send you
along to England.  More than that I cannot do
for you."
</p>

<p>
He touched the bell.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Cyril, "but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Jim, take this youngster to the cook," said
Mr. Ellison to his errand-boy, "and tell him to give
the lad something to eat and drink."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, boss.  Come along."  The last two words
were addressed to Cyril, who followed him from the
office immediately.
</p>

<p>
The boy conducted Cyril into a large room in the
great house where the master saw-miller lived with
such of his men as were unmarried.  Then a man
wearing a white cap placed a dish of hot meat,
bread, and coffee before him, at one end of a very
long table.
</p>

<p>
Just as Cyril was sitting down to the meal Ben
and his father entered, and came quickly towards
him.
</p>

<p>
"Here he is, father.  Here is the boy whose
brave true words spoke a message from heaven to
my soul," said Ben.
</p>

<p>
The old man laid a hard but gentle hand on
Cyril's head.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p62"></a>
"God bless you!" he said fervently; "God bless
you!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Cyril in a low tone.  He felt
very glad to think he had done so much good, but
it was a little embarrassing too; so he hastened
to speak of other things.  "Green&mdash;I mean Ben,"
said he, "aren't you going to have some breakfast?
Oh, yes, here comes the cook with another plate."
</p>

<p>
The man with the white cap laid the plate before
Ben, regarding him curiously as he did so.
</p>

<p>
After he had gone the old man spoke.  "Ben,"
he said, "my son, you've repented; yes, but the
consequences of your wrong-doing remain.  Your
band has done a good deal of mischief in this
neighbourhood, and at any moment you may be
recognised.  You'll have to be disguised in some
way."
</p>

<p>
"I'll shave my beard and whiskers off, and you
must cut my hair quite close, father," said Ben.
"Then if you'll kindly get me some clothes like
yours, you'll see I shall look very different.  If
any of my old associates ever come this way, it
must be quite impossible for them ever to recognise
me."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, my lad.  What would that desperate Captain
do if he came across you?"
</p>

<p>
"Shoot me as soon as think of it," replied his
son.
</p>

<p>
Cyril trembled.  From what he had seen of the
Captain he was sure it would be so.  "But these
saw-millers are very powerful, Ben, aren't they?"
he asked.  "They couldn't easily be overcome, could
they?"
</p>

<p>
"Not likely," Ben answered, "if it came to a fair
fight."
</p>

<p>
After the meal was over Ben shaved, and his
father cut his hair quite close to his head.  Then
he dressed in the rough garments worn by the
men at the saw-mill.  His transformation was so
complete that even Cyril did not know him when
he returned to the big room.
</p>

<p>
Then, and not till then, did the old man take
him to the master.
</p>

<p>
A little later in the day, when Cyril had been
shown over all "the works," and had seen the
different operations whereby great forest trees were
sawn into boards, smoothed, planed, and piled up
in mighty heaps ready for transportation, he learnt
that Mr. Ellison had been very kind to Ben, and
had engaged his services, that he might remain
there and work with his father.  The old man was
most pleased and thankful; and his son and he
made very much of Cyril, and were never tired of
telling him how grateful they were to him for being
the means of their present happiness.  The boy did
not like to disturb and distress them by letting
them know of his own bitter disappointment in not
being assisted at once to return to England.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ellison was very kind to him in other ways.
He allowed him to sleep in a tiny room opening
into his own bedroom, and at meal times Cyril's
plate was always set near the master's.
</p>

<p>
"He's a little gentleman," said the rough
saw-miller; "he shall sit near me."
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, when "the boss" was resting, he would
talk kindly to Cyril, explaining to him all about the
wonderful work which went on in the heart of that
strange, wild land.
</p>

<p>
"You would never think, lad," said he, "that
houses built in London, York, Sheffield, Liverpool,
and so on, in the old country, are floored and partly
'run up' with boards made of our forest pines.  Yet
it is so; our timber goes to the wood markets of old
England."
</p>

<p>
Then he related graphically how large parties of
men, called lumberers, came over to Michigan and
Canada just before the long winter and set up great
camps, at which they lived a hard, rough life, going
out long before light on intensely cold winter mornings
to fell the giant pine trees, and returning early
in the evenings to eat and sleep heavily until it was
again time to go to work.  In the winter months
when the ground was covered with snow and ice the
forest would resound with the blows of the axe, and
the trees would lie prone on the ground until they
were chained together into rough sleighs and dragged
over the frozen snow to the banks of the frozen rivers.
There they would lie waiting until the spring, when
the ice would melt, and the timber would be slipped
into the river and borne by the force of the current
on, on, for many miles until it reached its destination.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "our timber comes floating down to
us on our river.  We stop it when it reaches us, and
saw it up as you have seen.  Afterwards the same
river bears it away towards its distant market."
</p>

<p>
"Then the river is your road, your railway, and
everything," said Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And we make the water serve us doubly.
It is our carriage or boat, as well as our road or
river."  And then Mr. Ellison told him of greater
wonders still, of timber being formed into gigantic
rafts, these "shooting the rapids" and being "tugged"
across lakes by steamers.
</p>

<p>
It was all very wonderful; Cyril was deeply
interested.  But still he longed to leave that marvellous
country to return to his friends and his father's friends
in old England.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
<i>ATTACKED BY BEARS.</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Cyril!  Cyril!  Where are you?" called
Mr. Ellison one morning.
</p>

<p>
"Coming," answered Cyril, from the
top of a huge pile of logs.  He had found a comfortable,
sheltered seat up there, which he called his
"retreat," and, though it was hard to climb up to
it, he often sat there, thinking about England and
the father he had lost.  That morning he felt more
sorrowful than usual, and his eyes were red and
swollen when at last he reached Mr. Ellison's side.
</p>

<p>
The saw-miller was standing in the middle of the
yard, looking at a pretty black pony which a strange
man was holding by the bridle.
</p>

<p>
"Good.  You shall have your price," said the
saw-miller.  "Now, my lad," he added, turning to
Cyril, "can you ride?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the boy at once, "I have a pony
at home."  He looked sad as he thought what a long
way off that was.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this shall be your pony then," said
Mr. Ellison, smiling; "Blackie&mdash;that's his name&mdash;is for
you.  I've just bought him for you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, thank you!  How very kind!"
exclaimed Cyril delightedly.  "Blackie!  Woa, my
beauty!"  He stroked the pretty creature, patting
his arched neck.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, take him&mdash;take him!" said the man,
slipping the bridle into Cyril's hand.  "I guess you
may ride him bare-back, or any way you like.  He's
quiet enough, you'll find."
</p>

<p>
The pony had no saddle on, and Cyril did not
wait for one to be brought.  Jumping lightly on
Blackie's sleek, bare back, he trotted quickly round
the yard.  His pleasure in the welcome gift, and
the pleasant movement through the clear, frosty air,
brought a bright colour to his cheeks.  He sat erect,
and the dark skin cap Mr. Ellison had given him
contrasted with his fair, curly hair, and made his face
appear brighter than ever.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ellison looked admiringly at the boy.  He had
no child of his own.  His wife had long been dead.
He was all alone.  Like the Captain of the brigands
he thought it might be well for him to adopt Cyril,
and so felt less inclined than before to hasten his
departure to England.
</p>

<p>
Certainly after that day the boy seemed happier
and more settled.  He was generally on Blackie's back,
trotting about all over the place, and often riding
some distance into the forest on the roads made by
the lumberers.  Blackie was a capital companion.
When Cyril was not riding him he followed his young
master about like a dog.  Sometimes Cyril found
himself talking to the animal as if it could understand
him.  He told Blackie about his distant home in
England, and his great wish to return to it, even
though no kind father would be there now to welcome
him.  And sometimes as he talked his tears dropped
down over Blackie's head, upon which the pony
would poke his nose quietly against the boy's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
One day when Cyril was alone with Blackie in a
part of the forest where the trees had just been felled,
about two miles from the saw-mill, he saw something
which made him throw himself from his saddle and
run to the rescue.  A baby bear had been entrapped
by a falling tree, one branch of which lay over one of
its hind legs, which was broken.  The poor beast's
moans were pitiful, but when Cyril approached it
snarled at him fiercely.
</p>

<p>
The boy found, to his distress, that he could not
move the heavy bough, and he was just stooping over
it, preparatory to making another tremendous effort
to do so, when an angry growl behind him caused
him to look round quickly.
</p>

<p>
Close by him was the young cub's dam, in a
towering rage, one mighty paw upraised to strike
him down.
</p>

<p>
Cyril thought his last hour had come.  Having
no weapon with him, he was quite defenceless.  The
bear, imagining he had injured her offspring, was
bent upon killing him.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-070"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-070.jpg" alt="&quot;The bear was bent upon killing him.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;The bear was bent upon killing him.&quot;
</p>

<p>
One moment she towered over him, a huge, grey
monster; then, just as he was breathing a prayer
to his Heavenly Father for the help which in his
heart he despaired of, a voice cried loudly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Drop on your face, lad!  Down on your face,
and let me get a shot at her."
</p>

<p>
Cyril flung himself down as he was bidden; the
bear growled again fiercely, and turned to look at
the intruder.
</p>

<p>
A shot rang through the air, another, and yet
another.
</p>

<p>
With an anguished snarl the bear dropped down
beside her young one, mortally wounded.
</p>

<p>
Cyril jumped up to look in the face of his deliverer.
It was Mr. Ellison, who had come up just in the nick
of time.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, my lad," said the saw-miller with emotion,
"you had a narrow escape that time."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you&mdash;oh, thank you for saving my life!"
cried Cyril.
</p>

<p>
The saw-miller sat down on a fallen tree to rest
for a minute.  "You must have the skin," he said,
trying to speak coolly, though his voice still shook
with emotion.
</p>

<p>
"But look at the poor little one!  I believe it's
dying.  Oh, do look!" exclaimed Cyril.
</p>

<p>
The young bear was indeed expiring.  As Cyril
bent over it another large bear, with a terrific growl,
rushed upon the scene.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ellison's weapon was unloaded now.  They
were quite defenceless.  The bear had the deaths
of his poor mate and their cub to avenge.  He was
full of fury.
</p>

<p>
The saw-miller looked fixedly at the beast, trying
to cow it with his eyes; but the bear's eyes were
turned in the direction of Cyril.  With a low growl
it watched him angrily.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
<i>CYRIL SPEAKS UP FOR THE INDIANS.</i>
</h3>

<p>
As Cyril looked round hastily he perceived
Mr. Ellison's box of matches, with which
he had just been lighting his pipe, and at
the same moment the thought flashed across his
mind that fire was a mighty power.  Perhaps the
bear could by its means be scared away.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he snatched up the match-box, struck a
light, and applied it to the dry leaves and withered
boughs beside him.
</p>

<p>
An instant conflagration was the result.  A wave
of fire leaped up between them and the bear.
</p>

<p>
The beast, snarling, drew back a yard or so, then
sat up watching the flames with much distrust.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, lad!" shouted Mr. Ellison, stirring up
the fire and spreading it out between them and the
bear, which retreated still further, with a prolonged
growl.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-074"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-074.jpg" alt="&quot;The bear retreated still further with a prolonged growl.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;The bear retreated still further with a prolonged growl.&quot;
</p>

<p>
That fire saved two lives.  It did not spread very
far, because the trees were felled and piled up in
places, ready to be removed.  But it answered its
purpose.  The bear was driven off, and the
saw-miller and Cyril returned home in safety.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ellison had the skin of the she-bear dressed
and cured for Cyril.  He lavished favours upon the
boy, and thought of him almost as his own son;
only in regard to the matter of sending him to
England he was stern, unyielding.  Why could not
Cyril give up the wish and remain with him?  But
Cyril thought longingly of the old country.  If he
could only get there, and could tell Mr. Betts, the
lawyer, everything that had happened, that gentleman
might be able to find out what his father's
ultimate fate had been.
</p>

<p>
One morning, just before the long winter
commenced, half a dozen poor Indian women (squaws
they were called) came to the saw-mill with three
ponies laden with goods they wished to sell to the
men.
</p>

<p>
It happened to be the dinner hour, and a number
of young fellows were crossing the yard on
their way to the house when they saw the poor
Indians.  They shouted merry greetings and laughed
boisterously.
</p>

<p>
"Now we shall have some fun," said they.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of fun?" asked Cyril, who happened
to be near.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you will see," was the answer.  "They are so
simple, these queer-looking squaws."
</p>

<p>
Cyril did see, and very indignant he became.
</p>

<p>
The poor squaws had brought warm wool mittens
and skin caps, for which they asked a fair price, and
hoped to do a good business.  But the squaws had one
great weakness, and the men at the saw-mill knew
it well.  They could not refuse a glass of beer, and
they were so unused to it and so constituted that a
very small quantity of alcohol completely upset
them.  Even one glass of beer would make them
quite foolish.
</p>

<p>
The young men therefore refused to trade with
them until they had refreshed themselves, as they
called it, with a little beer.  After that they easily
persuaded the Indians to part with their goods
for the most trifling sum, in some cases for only
another glass, or perhaps two, of beer.
</p>

<p>
Cyril looked on in amazement.  Would no one
interfere?  Were these men who were trading on the
folly and sin of a few poor women?
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Davidson, see," cried Cyril, "that fellow,
Jem, is trying to get one of their ponies now!
That poor woman will be quite ruined!  Just look
at her."
</p>

<p>
Davidson had no objection to looking; but "I
can't interfere," said he slowly.  "It's a shame,
though I can't help it."
</p>

<p>
Cyril's colour rose.  If no one would venture to
interfere&mdash;well, he must do it himself.  Davidson,
glancing at him, read his thought, and laid a
detaining hand upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't speak," he said.  "The man
wouldn't stand it&mdash;least of all from a little fellow
like you."
</p>

<p>
Cyril's eyes flashed.  "I may be small," said he,
"but right is right, and must&mdash;<i>must</i> triumph," and he
ran forward, crying out aloud, "Stop!  Stop!  Stop!
You're not acting fairly!"
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, when Cyril lay on his hard,
straw mattress in his little bedroom, aching and sore
all over from the rough treatment he had met with,
he did not think the right had triumphed at all, and
he sobbed his heart out there in his loneliness and
despair.
</p>

<p>
The men would not brook interference.  What
their master and old Davidson dare not attempt
the boy, armed only with his consciousness of right,
had ventured upon doing.  The consequences were
grievous to himself, and might have been fatal if it
had not been for the Davidsons, aided by their
master, who suddenly opened his office door for them
to rush into with the boy.  There were no police
within many miles of the lonely saw-mill.  The
master ruled alone over the lawless roughs who, in
a great measure, composed his staff.
</p>

<p>
The occurrence of that morning made Mr. Ellison
see that the saw-mill was not a safe home for such a
boy as Cyril.  He began to think of plans for
sending him back to England.  Unfortunately, however,
the sky was already black with threatening
snow-storms; the weather would probably be such that it
would be impossible to take Cyril thirty miles to the
nearest station.  And then, he had been so cuffed
and knocked about by the men, it was most likely
that he would be ill.
</p>

<p>
The idea of that made the saw-miller go back to
Cyril's bedside.
</p>

<p>
"Are you any better, my lad?" he asked
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Cyril could scarcely say he was; all his bruises
smarted, and his bones ached.  He looked up at
Mr. Ellison without speaking.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry this has happened," said the latter, very
feelingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it doesn't matter about me," said Cyril
quickly.  "I don't mind being knocked about a bit.
But the pity is that it has done <i>no good</i>&mdash;no good,"
and he sighed deeply, thinking of the hard, cruel
hearts of the men, and the wrongs of the poor
Indian women.
</p>

<p>
"You can't say that," said the master, "you can't
say that.  Some of the men will feel ashamed when
they think over what happened.  They will see you
were in the right, and&mdash;well, I fancy the next time
the poor squaws come they will not be treated so
badly."
</p>

<p>
"If that is so," said Cyril, smiling in spite of his
pain, "I shan't mind having been knocked about a
little, Mr. Ellison."
</p>

<p>
The saw-miller looked at his bright, if discoloured,
face, and felt it hard to say the next words.  "I've
made up my mind, my lad; you shall go straight
away to England as soon as it can be arranged."
</p>

<p>
Cyril was very glad to hear that.  It comforted
him immensely in his pain to think that he might
soon be on his way home.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
<i>A JOYFUL MEETING.</i>
</h3>

<p>
Cyril was ill for several weeks after the
assault upon him by the angry men at
Mr. Ellison's saw-mill.  When at last he
crept out of his bedroom, looking pale and thin,
winter had begun in good earnest, and the rough
roads through the forest were quite impassable.
The snow was coming down as if it never meant
to stop, and the keen, cold wind blew it in great
drifts on every side.
</p>

<p>
Whilst Cyril lay ill on his hard mattress two
travellers going south to Chicago had called at the
saw-mill; with either of them he might have travelled
had he been well enough to do so.  It was all very
trying, and sometimes the boy was inclined to
murmur at the cruel results which had followed
his well-meant attempt to defend the cause of the
poor Indians.  But then again he was reassured, as
his constant attendant, old Davidson, told him of
first one and then another of the men having
expressed contrition about their treatment, not only
of the boy, but also of the poor Indian women.
It had never struck them before, they said, that
it was wrong to cheat a redskin.  Until the
English boy stood up and called their conduct
monstrous it had seemed quite the proper thing.
They had bitterly resented being corrected, and
had beaten their monitor for doing it, but afterwards,
as Mr. Ellison had foretold, they saw that
he was in the right.  Under the influence of these
better feelings they were easily led by the Davidsons
to unite in sending Cyril a message that they
apologised for thrashing him, and promised that in
future they would respect the rights even of poor
Indians.
</p>

<p>
The thought of all this greatly consoled Cyril, and
helped him to bear patiently his pain and weakness,
and the disappointment about his delayed return
home.
</p>

<p>
When at last he was strong enough to travel,
and the roads were not so bad, no one happened
to be going south, and Mr. Ellison really could not
send him just then.  As the time went on, therefore,
he felt very sad and lonely.
</p>

<p>
One evening, however, as he sat musing sorrowfully
in the men's sitting-room&mdash;his heart too sore
to allow him to join in the usual fun&mdash;he heard
the sound of approaching horses clattering over the
frozen yard.  Then there was a loud rap at the door,
followed by many others, louder and louder still,
as the person outside endeavoured to make himself
heard within the house.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ellison strode to the door and threw it open.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I have come in search of&mdash;" began a rich,
courteous voice.
</p>

<p>
"Father!"  The cry, so joyous, so eloquent with
tenderness, rang through the room.  Then Cyril flew
across the boarded floor and flung himself into the
open arms of the new-comer.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father! father! father!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy!  My Cyril!  Thank God!  Oh,
thank God!" and the tall, fur-clad man in the
doorway clasped his child to his heart.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"But, father," asked Cyril an hour later, as they
sat together talking in his little bedroom, which
Mr. Morton had obtained Mr. Ellison's permission
to share with his son that night&mdash;"but, father, I can
understand your coming round after everyone had
thought you dead, and also your having quite a long
illness after that, but I don't know yet how it was
you found me.  Why have you not told me that,
father dear?"
</p>

<p>
"We have been so very happy, Cyril, for this
last hour, and that is a sad story.  Must you hear
it to-night, my boy?  Can you not wait till
to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! tell me now, please," said Cyril wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, my boy."  But the father sighed.
"You know the police were busy a long time,
trying to find the scoundrels who attacked the
train.  They did so at last, and after a desperate
fight some of them were secured.  They were tried
in the police-court in Menominee, where I and
some others had to bear witness against them.  It
was proved that two of them had been guilty of
murder.  The captain was one and Whiterock, the
man who attacked me, was another."
</p>

<p>
"But, father, Whiterock didn't kill you after all!"
said Cyril quickly.
</p>

<p>
"No, not me.  But unfortunately he killed someone
else, and he was condemned to die.  Shortly
before the hour of his death the prison chaplain
sent me a note to tell me that the criminal, Whiterock,
greatly desired to see me.  Of course I visited
his cell as soon as I could.  Then Whiterock told
me that he wished to do one just deed before he
died.  He had carried you away from the train and
caused you to fall into the brigands' power; he
would try to atone for that by telling me all about
you and where you were."
</p>

<p>
"But how did he know&mdash;&mdash;" began Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he said he and his party generally got to
hear all that they wanted to know about people.
You and the man who left them had not been here
very long before they were aware of it.  However,
it did not suit their purpose to molest either of you,
although they meant to punish their renegade
comrade at some future date.  I was deeply
thankful to know that you were here in safety, and
I came for you as soon as I could.  Whiterock
left this message for you, Cyril&mdash;'Tell your son,'
he said, 'that I've found at last that honesty <i>is</i>
the best policy.  And tell him, too, that he did
right to speak those brave, true words to us, and
right, too, not to pretend, even for an hour, that
he could be one of us&mdash;villains.'"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Whiterock," said Cyril softly.  "He saved
my life once, father!  He was good to me then."
</p>

<p>
"We will only think of that," said Mr. Morton,
"and of his kindness in telling me where I might
find you.  And now, my boy, we must go to bed.
To-morrow, as I have had to give up my fruitless
search for your uncle, we will start for home."
</p>

<p>
"Home," murmured Cyril, as his head touched
the pillow, "with father," and he fell asleep.  A
smile rested on his face.  He was a happy boy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
<i>LEAVING THE SAW-MILL.</i>
</h3>

<p>
"This is very awkward!  Very!" exclaimed
Mr. Morton the next day, when, on
joining his host at the great breakfast-table,
he heard that his guide of the day before
had changed his mind about returning with him
to the nearest railway station, twenty miles away.
The man wished to remain at the saw-mill, having
found an old mate there.
</p>

<p>
"I can do with him very well," said the saw-miller,
"as I am rather short of hands just now.
All the same, I don't wish to take the fellow from
you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course, I engaged him to guide me
here and back, and I can make it worth his while
to return with me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'll compel him to do that, if you like!"
said Mr. Ellison.  "But you might find him a bit
nasty.  I know the man, who has been here before;
he has an ugly temper."
</p>

<p>
"Then we are better without him.  After all,
I believe I can remember the way; we can scarcely
call it a road.  It is in nearly a straight line, is it
not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for about half the distance.  Then you
come to a place where the track, or way, branches
out in two directions.  You must take the turn to
the right&mdash;you'll remember right's right&mdash;and go
straight on.  There is no difficulty."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I'll dispense with Smith's services."
</p>

<p>
"I should if I were you.  It's nice weather, clear
and frosty, the snow as hard as any road.  You'll
find your horses, animated by the fine exhilarating
air, will gallop over it splendidly."
</p>

<p>
"Will you sell me a mount for the boy?" asked
Mr. Morton.
</p>

<p>
"He has his own pony.  Of course he will take
that."
</p>

<p>
"May I?" asked Cyril eagerly.  "Oh, Mr. Ellison,
may I really take Blackie?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes shone with delight.  He had been
thinking that morning how hard it would be for him
to leave his dear pony, notwithstanding his great
happiness.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course, Cyril.  The pony is your own.
I gave it to you long ago," answered Mr. Ellison.
</p>

<p>
"And he's such a stunning pony, father.  He
follows me like a dog, and he's never tired; he
goes like the wind.  And such a beauty!  There
isn't one like him in England, I'm sure; at least,
I don't think there can be."
</p>

<p>
"I must see him," said his father.  "You've been
very kind to my boy," he added gratefully to the
saw-miller.
</p>

<p>
The big man laid his hand on Cyril's head as
he sat beside him.  "I would give half of all that
I possess," he said to Mr. Morton, "to have a boy
like him.  My wife and infant son died thirteen
years ago," he added rather huskily.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ellison grasped his hand.  "I have lost Cyril's
mother too, for a time," he said very softly.
</p>

<p>
"A time?  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Please God, we shall meet again in a better
world," replied Mr. Morton in low tones full of
deep feeling.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you are a happy man!" said the saw-miller,
so low that no one else could hear.  "It's all plain
sailing with you.  You'll get to heaven, I've no
doubt.  But with me it's very different.  It's a
rough life this of mine, trying to wrest a living
out of the heart of the forest, far from any help of
religion or even civilisation; I try to keep straight,
but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know you do," exclaimed Mr. Morton.  "You've
been so good to my boy.  You know our Lord's
words, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.'"
</p>

<p>
The saw-miller's eyes filled with tears of surprise
and joy; he brushed his hand across them hastily
lest they should be seen.  At heart he was a very
humble man, although he had to appear stern and
proud to the men, who, generally, obeyed him as if
he were a sort of king over them.
</p>

<p>
"And you are not really alone," continued Mr. Morton,
still speaking in the low tones which could
not be heard by the others at the table.  "Although
you have no outside spiritual aids, no place of
worship, and no clergyman, you have the promise,
'Lo, I am with you always.'"
</p>

<p>
"But was that meant for me?" asked the saw-miller.
"I always thought that was only meant for
the parsons."
</p>

<p>
"It was meant for everyone who, in all future
times, should endeavour ever so humbly to tread in
the steps of our great Exemplar, the Lord Jesus
Christ."
</p>

<p>
That was all that passed just then.  The "boss"
was obliged to turn to his men, and dismiss them
to their work with a few pointed directions.  But
when Mr. Morton was ready to ride away, after
having looked round the place where his little son
had lived so long, thanked the Davidsons for their
kindness to him, and seen the affectionate way in
which they and some of the other men parted from
him, the saw-miller came up hastily and wrung his
hand, saying, "Good-bye.  I can understand now
how it is Cyril became what he is.  I shall think
of your words after you have gone."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye.  God bless you!" said the grateful
father.
</p>

<p>
Cyril threw his arms round the saw-miller's neck
and kissed him for the first and last time on his
hard, bronzed face.  "Good-bye, dear Mr. Ellison,"
he said, "I shall write you ever such long letters
from England.  And I'll tell you all about how
Blackie likes the old country.  I can't thank you
enough for giving me Blackie.  I can't indeed."  For
he estimated the gift of Blackie more highly than
any other kindness the great saw-miller had shown
him.
</p>

<p>
Then he had to follow his father, who had
already ridden on, and the saw-miller stood looking
after them until they were out of sight among the
trees.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, boss," remarked Ben Davidson, meeting
him as he crossed the yard to his office, "that
we shall have snow again, after all, before long.  It
has begun to grow darker during the last five
minutes," and he scanned the sky with a troubled
face.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope it won't come until they have
arrived at the station.  I did not think there would
be snow, or I should not have allowed them to go,
although Mr. Morton was most anxious to be off
home."
</p>

<p>
And with these words the saw-miller passed
into his office, looking disturbed and not altogether
happy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
LOST IN THE SNOW.
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Morton and Cyril rode on briskly,
Blackie keeping up most cleverly with
the larger horse, until when they were
about eight miles on their way the snow which
Ben Davidson had prognosticated began to fall
heavily and in the most bewildering manner.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw such snow in my life!" exclaimed
Mr. Morton.  "It does not come down straight, it
whirls all about and rises again and beats upon one
in such a blinding fashion.  Stay near me, Cyril, my
boy.  Can you keep your pony up?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father.  He stumbles rather, but he won't
fall.  He's such a good pony, isn't he, father?"
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!  And you're a capital rider!"
</p>

<p>
They pushed on as rapidly as possible, but it soon
became exceedingly difficult for their horses to
advance.  The newly fallen snow was so much softer
than the hard iced snow covering the track, it rolled
into balls under the horse's hoofs, making them
stumble and flounder sadly.  At last Mr. Morton's
horse fell down, slightly crushing his foot, which he
had not time to release from the stirrup.  He turned
very white with the pain, and it was a few moments
before he could extricate himself from the horse.
Cyril was in an agony of apprehension.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father, are you hurt?" he cried.  Then, as
Mr. Morton made no reply, he jumped off his pony
and caught hold of him by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be all right soon," his father replied with
an effort, leaning heavily on him.  "My foot is
sprained, I think.  It rather pains me, that's
all."  But he grew pale to the lips.
</p>

<p>
His horse stood by, hanging his head and looking
quite ashamed.
</p>

<p>
"My Blackie wouldn't have done that!" cried
Cyril, and as if the pony understood him he came
poking his nose into his master's hands.
</p>

<p>
All the time the snow was falling fast, whirling
round, and beating in their faces.  It had covered
the track now, so that except for the opening in
the trees they could not tell where it was.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Morton endeavoured to mount his horse again,
but in vain.  Frightened by his fall and the
bewildering snow the animal jumped about and would
not stand still, whilst the pain his master's foot gave
him when he stood upon it crippled all his efforts.
</p>

<p>
Letting go Blackie's bridle&mdash;the pony would not
stir without him&mdash;Cyril held his father's horse,
patted his neck, and endeavoured to pacify him, but
in vain.
</p>

<p>
It grew darker; the snow rose in great drifts now,
and flung itself upon them with stinging force.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Morton struggled hard against the faintness
and drowsiness which was stealing over him.  "My
boy," he said, "it is no use.  I cannot ride.  The
horse would only fall again."
</p>

<p>
"But, father, what shall we do?" cried Cyril.
"I've heard of people in this country being buried
in the snow whilst yet alive, and of their being
starved to death too."
</p>

<p>
"If only there were some shelter!" sighed his
father, "a hollow tree, or a cave, or something.
Look round, Cyril, can't you see anything?"
</p>

<p>
Cyril endeavoured to look through the snow, but
could see nothing except snow&mdash;snow in all directions,
whirling about, drifting high, covering the
trees till it made them look gigantic cloud-like
mountains, and piling itself up against them as
they stood until it really seemed to be trying to
bury them all alive.
</p>

<p>
Tinkle!  Tinkle!  Tinkle!  The sound of sleigh
bells, proceeding slowly in their direction, was the
most welcome music to their ears that they had ever
heard.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" exclaimed Mr. Morton, making
a renewed effort to resist the faintness stealing over
him, "thank God!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father, it's a sleigh!  I know the sound of
sleigh bells!" exclaimed Cyril, "and there will be
people, and they will take us somewhere!"  In his
glad excitement he let go of the bridle he was
holding, upon which the horse immediately turned
tail and bolted, floundering through the snow.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!  I couldn't help it!" cried the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind; he was of no use.  Who&mdash;who is
coming?" faltered his father, still struggling with the
deadly weakness.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!  Hey!  What's up?" exclaimed a sharp,
girlish voice, as a two-horse sleigh came up with
frantic plunges and great difficulty on the part of
the horses.  A girl, warmly clad in furs, who was
shovelling snow off the sleigh with one hand, whilst
with the other she held the reins, peered through
her wraps at the obstruction on the road.
</p>

<p>
"We've had an accident," answered Cyril, in shrill
tones of excitement.  "We were riding to the station
at Iron Mountain when my father's horse fell.  He's
badly hurt and faint.  <i>My</i> pony didn't fall!" he
added quickly, in spite of his trouble, still proud of
Blackie.  "But I don't know what to do about my
father.  His horse finished off with bolting, you
know."
</p>

<p>
The girl was staring through the blinding snow
at Cyril as he spoke.  "Why, it's only a child!"
she ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
Cyril thought her rude, and felt hurt she should
imagine he was small, but that was no time for
thinking of himself.  He was alarmed because his
father did not speak, though he stood swaying in
first one direction and then another as the snow beat
upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Bless me!" cried the girl.  "We must get your
dad on my sleigh, though I doubt whether the horses
can pull him."  She jumped off the sleigh as she
spoke and towered above Cyril, being a fine, tall
young woman, as she offered her arm to his father.
"You must rouse yourself, sir," she said commandingly,
"and get into this sleigh.  See!  I'll help you!
Make a great effort.  For your life, sir!"
</p>

<p>
Her loud voice reached the injured traveller in the
far-away region into which he seemed to have sunk;
he made a great effort, and with the help of the girl
and Cyril succeeded in getting on the sleigh.  There
he sank down unconscious, and the girl pulled a big
skin rug over him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, little one," she cried sharply, "jump on your
pony and show us what stuff you are made of!  If
you can ride on in front my horses will follow
you!"
</p>

<p>
It was no time to resent the freedom of her speech.
Cyril knew their lives depended upon getting through
that terrible snow as speedily as possible.
</p>

<p>
"Blackie, Blackie," he cried in his pony's ear.  "My
dear old Blackie, do your best!"
</p>

<p>
The pony neighed and struggled on as best he
could, but it was terribly hard work and he floundered
about miserably.  It was all Cyril could do to stick on.
Once he thought it would be impossible to do so
any longer, and looked back.
</p>

<p>
Then he saw the girl who had come so opportunely
to their aid had a still harder task than his.  Leaving
the horses to follow his pony, she was working hard
with both hands at shovelling the snow off the sleigh,
which jumped about and jolted up and down owing
to the plunges of the horses and the drifts of snow it
encountered.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care if she does call me a little one!" said
Cyril to himself, forgiving her everything at that
moment.  "She's a heroine, a real, splendid
heroine!"  And again he urged Blackie forward.
</p>

<p>
He was absorbed in the difficulties of the way, and
so blinded by the snow that he was quite unconscious
they had passed the place where the track parted in
two directions, and were now pursuing the left one
instead of the right.  But the girl knew what she
was doing, and when at last even Blackie fell on
his knees and Cyril alighted on his hands and feet,
unhurt, on the snow and a yard ahead of his pony,
she called out encouragingly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It's all right.  We're just close to a house.
You're a brave lad, for all you are so small!"
</p>

<p>
Cyril got up, leaving Blackie to recover his feet
as he could, and made his way to her side.
</p>

<p>
"Do you say there is a house?" he asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; through those trees.  Do you see that
narrow opening?  There.  Look!  'Tis a path that
leads to the door.  It isn't many yards."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" cried Cyril.  "How can we get father
there?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  We must be sharp.  I guess you
had better run to the house and see if there's
anybody there.  It's just a chance there may be.  And
bring them back to help us carry your father.  Woa!"
she cried to the horses, which, stung by the snow,
were plunging about again.  "Steady there!  Look
sharp, boy."
</p>

<p>
Cyril made his way as fast as he could over the
snow-path through the trees; fortunately for him it
was so sheltered that not much new snow had fallen
upon it.  After proceeding a few yards he stepped
out of the shelter of the trees into what seemed a
great snow-drift, which at first appeared impassable;
by degrees, however, he perceived a way round it,
which eventually brought him suddenly to the
window-frame of a wooden house.
</p>

<p>
Looking in Cyril perceived a man dressed as a
hunter kneeling on the floor, apparently digging a
hole in the earth about the centre of the room; some
boards he had taken up lay beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Come," cried Cyril to him, "come, my father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by a great cry, as the man,
springing to his feet, flung up his arms in extreme
terror.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
<i>A CONFESSION OF GUILT</i>
</h3>

<p>
Cyril stared at the terrified man in
amazement.  The latter's cry rang through the
empty house and filled his ears.  What
had so frightened him?
</p>

<p>
"My father," began Cyril again, wishing to explain
his sudden appearance by saying that his father was
lying out in the snow, waiting to be carried into
shelter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Stop, stop!" cried the man, interrupting
him in apparent anguish.  "Mercy, father!  Father,
have mercy!"  He turned wildly as if to flee, but
thought better of it, and coming to the window
threw himself down on his knees before it, looking
up into Cyril's face with wild, unseeing eyes.  "I
didn't mean to kill yer, my father," he said.  "I only
wanted the gold.  And I can't find it.  I can't find
it.  And the snow-blindness is coming over me.  I
can scarcely see!  Oh, my punishment is great
enough!  Have pity on me!  Have pity on me!"
</p>

<p>
"What have you done?"  The voice that asked
the question was not Cyril's.  It was that of the girl,
who had followed him to the house, and her tone
was loud and very angry.  "Tell me again," she
demanded.  "I must hear it in your own words
again."
</p>

<p>
"I will tell yer.  Oh, I will!  Have mercy,
father!" wailed the unhappy man.  "I wanted
money so much, father, so very much.  I'd lost a
wager&mdash;a hundred pounds&mdash;to some men at Iron
Mountain, who said they would duck me in a pond
if I did not pay them it.  And I begged yer on my
knees, but yer wouldn't give me any.  So I thought
I'd help myself.  I knew yer hid your money in a
hole under the flooring 'ere, and was looking for it
when yer came to me.  I shouldn't 'ave killed yer
if yer 'adn't angered me with bad words.  Then
I was that put to, it seemed as if I killed yer before
I knew what I was doing."
</p>

<p>
"And Mr. Gerald?  What did he do?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, 'e knew nothing about it.  I guess I blamed
'im to get the blame off myself.  Now I've told
yer all," the wretched man whimpered.  "I've told
yer all.  Mercy!  Mercy, I beg!"  Lifting up his
hands, he cried still louder for mercy.
</p>

<p>
"Begone, then!" exclaimed the girl.  "Begone
this moment!  No, not that way.  Out of the door
at the back of the house, and then fly southwards.
If you ever return it will be at your own risk&mdash;your
own risk!"
</p>

<p>
"I never will, father!  I never will!"  The
wretched man fled through the house, out of the
back door into the snow, running against trees and
stumbling over drifts in his hurry to be gone.
</p>

<p>
The girl leaned against the window-frame, looking
extremely pale.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean?" asked Cyril.  "What does
it all mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Mean?" she said, and now once more she spoke
in her natural voice&mdash;the one she had been using to
the man was shrill and hard.  "Mean?  Why, just
this.  There is an old saying, 'Conscience makes
cowards of us all.'  'Tis true in this case.  His
guilty conscience made a coward of yon man.  His
father, a rich old miser, who lived in this house, was
killed six months ago&mdash;it was supposed for his
money.  Yon wretch accused a hunter, who had
been lodging with them, of the crime.  His name
was Gerald; he was a nice man, a real gentleman,
though very poor.  Appearances seemed against
him and he fled.  'Twas the worst thing he could
do.  Everyone, nearly, thought he must be guilty
then.  The house has been considered haunted by
the old man's ghost ever since.  It is lonely enough.
And yon wretch, returning to find the money which
he had not got after all, saw you, and being half
blind&mdash;if it's true he has snow-blindness[<a id="chap15fn1text"></a><a href="#chap15fn1">1</a>] coming
on&mdash;and frightened almost out of his wits, he thought
you were his father.  But," she changed her voice,
"we must now return to your father.  We shall have
to get him here the best way we can."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap15fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap15fn1text">1</a>] Snow-blindness is rather common in those parts.&mdash;E.C.K.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To their surprise and delight, however, they met
Mr. Morton coming towards them a minute later.
He had recovered consciousness, and finding himself
alone on a strange sleigh, wrapped in rugs, whilst
its two horses stood quite still, stupefied now with
fatigue and cold, he arose and made the best of
his way along the only semblance of a path
visible.
</p>

<p>
"Where am I?  What has happened?" were his
first questions.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked up into his face and smiled.
"'Pears like I have seen you before," she said.  "But
come in.  Don't talk now.  Come straight in and
sit down.  We'll have a fire in no time, and some
hot water for your poor foot."  She led the way into
the house as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
A few articles of furniture, too poor or too heavy
to be worth carrying away, had been left in the
room with the hole in the floor.  The girl dragged
forward an ancient arm-chair of the most elementary
workmanship and begged Mr. Morton to sit down
in it, near a strong table supported on what looked
like tree-trunks instead of legs.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my boy," she said to Cyril, "let's make
a fire.  There'll be wood in that chimney-corner,
I'll be bound.  Here's a match.  Oh, and here's
some paper!"  She pulled the latter articles out of
a huge pocket under her furs.  "Can you make a
fire, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can," he replied quickly.  "I've often
done it at the saw-mill."
</p>

<p>
"His name is Cyril Morton," interposed his father.
"I should like to know yours," he added to the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Mine's Cynthy&mdash;Cynthy Wood," she said, taking
an old kettle she had found to a running spring
in the kitchen.  "I'll rinse this old thing out, then
the water will be sweeter," she said cheerily.
</p>

<p>
"I ought to thank you," began Mr. Morton.
</p>

<p>
"Don't now.  Don't thank me," she said.  "I've
been repaid a thousandfold for coming here."
</p>

<p>
Cyril looked round at her wonderingly.  A vivid
blush had overspread one of the prettiest faces he
had ever seen.  Her blue eyes shone with gladness.
Her voice betrayed its happiness every time she
spoke.  She seemed altogether a different person
from the girl who had driven his father there.
</p>

<p>
"Now, you're wondering what has repaid me,"
she said to Cyril.  "Shouldn't be surprised if I
tell you after tea.  You make that kettle boil
sharp."
</p>

<p>
The boy laughed and poked the wood, which
was nice and dry, with his boot.  But Cynthy
reproved him for that, "Waste not, want not!" she
exclaimed.  "It's wrong to burn holes in good
leather.  Now, sir," she added to Mr. Morton, "let
me try to take your boot off."
</p>

<p>
With gentle hands, in spite of his protest, she
deftly removed Mr. Morton's boot from his injured
foot, then, fetching a basin from the inner room,
she bathed it in warm water, filling the kettle up
again after she had emptied it.
</p>

<p>
"It's swollen, sir," she said to her patient, "but
I think it's more bruised than sprained; I'll bind
it up for you."
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind, Miss Wood," said Mr. Morton.
</p>

<p>
"Now don't," she said.  "Call me Cynthy, everyone
does.  Cyril, you fetch me that stool," pointing
to one with three legs.  "Now, sir, you must keep
your foot up on the stool.  Cyril, you and I must
go back to the sleigh for some things I left there."
</p>

<p>
It was no easy task, but they struggled through
the snow back to the sleigh, which was already nearly
buried in it.
</p>

<p>
"The poor horses," said Cynthy; "I'd forgotten
them.  I shall cut them loose; they must look
after themselves.  I have no food for them.  I
think they will go home.  Then my father will
send to seek us."
</p>

<p>
Blackie was delighted to see Cyril again; he had
stood still, waiting for him to return, and now he
put his cold nose in the boy's hands, and seemed
to ask him not to go away again.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do with my dear old pony?" asked
Cyril.  "He has nowhere to go&mdash;he loves me so, he
will never leave me!"
</p>

<p>
"Can you get him along the path to the house?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes.  He followed me before, but I sent him
back.  He's very intelligent."
</p>

<p>
"Seems so," said Cynthy.  "Well, you bring him
along.  I guess he'll be able to get into the kitchen."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  do you think so?&mdash;but the people of the
house&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There are none.  The old man who owned it is
dead.  And his son and heir daren't come back,
because he thinks his father's ghost has returned!"  Cynthy
laughed.  "Remember this, Cyril," she added,
"there's nothing like a guilty conscience to make an
out-and-out coward."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
<i>THE DISCOVERY IN THE LOFT.</i>
</h3>

<p>
Blackie followed Cyril into the house
through the back door when they entered
it on their return from visiting the sleigh.
</p>

<p>
He did more; not content with his strange
quarters in the kitchen he followed his master into
the larger room, and trotted round it, looking hard at
everything, including Mr. Morton in the arm-chair,
and poking his nose into the hole in the middle of
the floor as if to see why it was left there.
</p>

<p>
"I guess he's a smart pony, but you must take
him right out, Cyril," said Cynthy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, of course.  Come, Blackie."  He led him
into the little kitchen, telling him repeatedly that he
was to be a good pony and stay quietly there.  But
Blackie whinnied a little, seeing no prospect of food.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor Blackie!" cried the boy sympathisingly;
"what will you do without food?"  He returned to
Cynthy, who was spreading out a nice little repast
of sandwiches, bottled milk, cheese, and bread and
butter on the rough table.
</p>

<p>
"Were all these things in that basket?" asked
Cyril, looking at the one they had fetched from the
sleigh.
</p>

<p>
"All except the sandwiches.  Your father provided
those," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"But I say, Cyril," she added, "aren't you going to
feed that pony of yours?"
</p>

<p>
"I only wish I could," he replied earnestly.  "But
unless you would give me a slice of bread for him,
I don't know what there is for him to eat."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what do you imagine there is in this bag?"
asked the girl, producing a coarse canvas bag from
amongst the rugs she had thrown down in a corner.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! is it corn?"
</p>

<p>
"Corn and chopped hay," she replied.  "The very
thing for Blackie.  I brought it for my horses, but
didn't give it to them, for they can find their way
home."
</p>

<p>
Cyril seized the bag eagerly, and with a grateful look,
without waiting to thank her, he ran to Blackie and
spread its contents out upon the floor.  Then he really
enjoyed seeing his pony eating the food with relish.
</p>

<p>
"Cyril!  Cyril!" called Cynthy at last.  "Come
and have some dinner yourself."
</p>

<p>
All at once, feeling very hungry, Cyril returned to
the other room and joined the others at the nice
impromptu meal.
</p>

<p>
After it was over, and the things were cleared
away&mdash;what was left of the food being carefully put
by&mdash;Cynthy told Mr. Morton what she had already
explained to Cyril, about the late owner of the house
and his wicked successor.  "He might have killed us
too," she said in conclusion, "or at any rate have
been very awkward, if I had not terrified him by
pretending to be his late father.  That was the only
plan I could think of to frighten him away&mdash;yes, I
see you look grave; it was trading on his fears, I
know.  But we really were in a desperate case.  The
horses could not possibly drag the sleigh another
inch, and it was absolutely necessary we should have
shelter from the snow."
</p>

<p>
"But what did that mean about Mr. Gerald?  I
did not quite understand," interposed Cyril.  "Who
is Mr. Gerald?"
</p>

<p>
"He is one of the best and gentlest of men,"
answered the girl, "so generous that he can never
keep a cent in his pocket if he thinks anyone else
has need of it.  He told me once he had been
extravagant and foolish in his youth away in
England, and had done harm to a few people
without really meaning it, and that made him
very anxious to do all the good he could to
others."
</p>

<p>
"A beautiful way of retrieving the past!" said
Mr. Morton.  "Would that everyone tried to do
that sort of thing!"
</p>

<p>
"You said that exactly as Mr. Gerald might have
done," exclaimed Cynthy, looking searchingly at her
patient.  "You do remind me of him."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you like Mr. Gerald a great deal,"
observed Cyril.
</p>

<p>
"I do indeed," said Cynthy, very earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell us why?" asked Mr. Morton,
regarding her with great interest.
</p>

<p>
Cynthy blushed deeply.  "I'm engaged to be
married," she said, "to a young man named Harry
Quilter.  He got into difficulties, and would have
been ruined by some men, up at Iron Mountain, if
it hadn't been for Mr. Gerald.  He took his part
and stuck up for him, besides paying some money
Harry owed.  And afterwards he got my Harry
to go about hunting with him until he'd got all
sorts of Mr. Gerald's wise maxims and good thoughts
into his head.  Now Harry has set up a store&mdash;a
shop, you know, only they call them all stores
here&mdash;and he's doing well.  My father says Mr. Gerald
has been the making of him."
</p>

<p>
"I am not surprised you think gratefully of him,"
said Mr. Morton.  "But how did such a man come
to be lodging in this lonely house?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know exactly, but I think he took
compassion on old Jabez, who always posed as a
very poor, half-starved old man, and thought it
would be kind to lodge with him and pay him well
for it when he hunted in this neighbourhood.  He
was always doing kind things like that.  Pete, the
old man's son, was a hunter too, and perhaps he
helped to persuade Mr. Gerald to lodge here, telling
him it was a good centre from which to hunt deer
in the forest round.  He used to go out hunting
with Mr. Gerald.  Perhaps he thought even then
that if he killed the old man whilst Mr. Gerald
was with them he might swear the latter did it.
He's that cunning, is Pete."
</p>

<p>
"How was the old man killed?"
</p>

<p>
"No one knows rightly.  Pete declared that
Mr. Gerald had knocked him down with the butt end
of his gun and thrown him into the river&mdash;the body
was never recovered."
</p>

<p>
"But how was it such a man as Pete could be
believed before this Mr. Gerald?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see the folks about here had known
Pete from a child; he had grown up amongst them,
and they never thought he could do it.  Then the
trappers and hunters and such-like all hang together,
and what one man says the others always hold by.
Besides, Mr. Gerald was an Englishman&mdash;and some
of the people here are rather set against the English
just now&mdash;and he had made himself a bit unpopular
by taking the cause of the weak and despised against
the richer, stronger men, and these last couldn't make
out what he did it for.  'We shall see through his
little game one day,' they said.  So when Pete said
Mr. Gerald had killed his father and taken all his
money&mdash;a very considerable amount&mdash;they believed
him.  But there weren't any police here, and there
was some delay, during which Mr. Gerald got away!
It was a pity he did that.  But he never cared much
for people's opinion, and he may have thought he
would rather go away than fight the matter out."  But
Cynthy sighed.  "It always makes a man look
guilty," she added, "when he runs away.  However,
Cyril, you've heard as well as I Pete's confession,
that he committed the crime himself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he said so!  What a fright he was in!"
cried the boy.  "I never saw anyone so much afraid
in my life!"
</p>

<p>
"A guilty conscience is a terrible thing," remarked
Mr. Morton.  "But, Cynthy," he added to the
American girl, "it is rather a coincidence that the
reason we came to North America was to find a
brother of mine, who went there many years ago,
named Gerald Morton."
</p>

<p>
"What was he like?" asked the girl at once, for
she had been greatly struck by Mr. Morton's
resemblance to her hero.  "Tell me just what he was
like."
</p>

<p>
"He was five feet ten inches in height," said
Mr. Morton.  "His hair a blend between gold and
red, his eyes were blue, and he used to look very
young and boyish."
</p>

<p>
Cynthy nodded.  "Mr. Gerald was all that you
have said, except the last," she remarked.  "He
looked anything but boyish, but then he had had
a hard struggle to get on.  You know this country
is not so easy for gentlemen without money to get
on in.  Poor men do better, because they have
strength with which to labour, and they often know
a trade.  Mr. Gerald had knocked about a great
deal, I know, before he settled down as a hunter."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if he can possibly be my brother," said
Mr. Morton.  "I should like to see the room he
occupied when he was here.  There might be some
traces of him in it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is the bedroom he had.  Up that ladder
it will be," said Cynthy.  "No, sir, please sit still.
I can't let you try to get up with that foot.  Cyril
can go up with me, and we will look round and
see if Mr. Gerald has left anything."
</p>

<p>
Cyril had already jumped up and run to the
wooden ladder leading up to a trap-door in the
boarded ceiling.  He climbed up before Cynthy,
and pushing open the trap-door, entered the loft-like
bedroom.
</p>

<p>
Cynthy followed him in, and they looked round.
A bed on the floor, a three-legged stool, a table of
very amateurish construction, and some torn papers
in a heap behind the door seemed to be all.
</p>

<p>
"What a poor place!" cried Cyril.  "Oh, I don't
think my Uncle Gerald can have lived here!"
</p>

<p>
"Let us look at these papers," said Cynthy, kneeling
down beside the heap on the floor.  "I'd scorn to
look at any man's torn letters," she said; "but if there
should be Mr. Gerald's real name on these, and it
should lead to his friends finding him, why it would
be such a good thing!  These, however, are mostly
torn memoranda and receipted bills.  See, there is
my father's name on one.  He keeps a big store at
Monkton, six miles off.  But what's this?"  She held
up an envelope with the words written upon it, "Cyril
Morton, Esq.," and the name Brooklands below, and
on the next line the letter T and a blot, as if the
address had never been completed."
</p>

<p>
"Why, that is papa's address!" exclaimed Cyril.
"Do you see the writer was just beginning to write
Truro when he stopped?  The next word would have
been Cornwall, and then it would have been finished.
And my father will know the writing."
</p>

<p>
"That he will.  We'll take all these papers to
him," said Cynthy, gathering them up.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
<i>THE GHOST.</i>
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Morton was much affected when
they placed in his hands the handwriting
of his long-lost brother, and he perceived
that Gerald had at least been thinking of him and
beginning a communication to him.  There was no
longer any doubt about the matter, his only brother
had lived in that poor frame-house for weeks together,
and had fled from it under suspicion of a terrible
crime.  That the suspicion was utterly false could
now be proved, thanks to Cyril and Cynthy's having
surprised and frightened the real culprit.  But Gerald
had gone, and it might be long before the good news
reached him.
</p>

<p>
"We will not go home, Cyril," said Mr. Morton,
"until we have found your uncle.  That is of the
most importance now."
</p>

<p>
"If he has gone to the lumberers, as Pete said,"
remarked Cynthy, "I have an idea in which direction
we must go to find him.  If only the snow has ceased
to-morrow I will guide you to the place.  I should
like nothing better," she added, as Mr. Morton
demurred about giving her so much trouble.  "They
are used to my going away for a few days at once,
at my home; I have relations scattered about the
country, and they will conclude I am visiting them."
</p>

<p>
Then, as night was drawing in, the clever girl
made up a good fire&mdash;fortunately there was a
sufficiency of wood in the house&mdash;and arranged the rugs
for Mr. Morton and Cyril to sleep on near the fire.
</p>

<p>
"I guess I'm going upstairs," she said, when this
had been done, and she ran lightly up the ladder
to the loft above before they could stop her.
</p>

<p>
"She'll be so cold up there, father!" exclaimed
Cyril.  "She'll freeze.  There isn't a fireplace in the
room, or anything but a poor bed on the floor."
</p>

<p>
"Run after her with this rug, Cyril," said
Mr. Morton, choosing the largest skin-rug.  "Tell her
I won't have it and neither will you.  We shall
be miserable if she starves herself."
</p>

<p>
Cyril did as he was told with great willingness,
but he had immense difficulty in making the
generous-hearted girl consent to take the rug.
</p>

<p>
"I'm young and strong, Cyril," she said, "and you
and your father are delicate.  Besides, you belong to
Mr. Gerald, so you ought to have the best of
everything."  But Cyril insisted, and she had to yield at last.
The tired travellers slept well and long, being
much exhausted with all they had gone through.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Morton awoke first, and had lighted the fire
before Cynthy appeared.
</p>

<p>
"I have been awake some time, but did not like
to disturb you too soon," she said, busying herself
with filling the kettle.  "Oh, now, sir," she added,
"you'll hurt your foot standing about on it so, and
there is no need.  I can soon do everything."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to say my foot is much better," rejoined
Mr. Morton, "and I am not going to allow you to do
everything."
</p>

<p>
Cynthy smiled brightly.  "I am glad you are
better," she said.  "But oh, look at the snow!" she
added, removing one of the boards with which she
had filled in the empty window-frame.
</p>

<p>
The snow was piled up until it almost reached the
top of the window, and they could see that more was
still coming down.  It was impossible to open the
door, which Cynthy tried next; a great snow-drift was
piled up against it.
</p>

<p>
"We are snowed in!" she exclaimed.  "And no one
will think of looking for us here in the haunted
house&mdash;unless my Harry does.  He knows I'm not a bit
superstitious.  Still, I don't think he'll suppose we
are here," and she grew thoughtful, weighing the pros
and cons.
</p>

<p>
They had to be very economical of food that day,
and there was none left for poor Blackie, much to
Cyril's grief.  Cynthy gave him some lumps of sugar
for his pony, but she could not spare any bread.
</p>

<p>
They all talked a great deal about Gerald Morton
in the course of the day, Cynthy relating many
anecdotes of the kindly deeds he had done for other
people, all of which much delighted Mr. Morton, who
asked many questions about them.  He told Cynthy
his brother had been left to his charge by a dying
mother, and it was a great grief to him when, having
failed in business and become ruined in fortune,
Gerald left England, as he said, to seek his fortune
in another country.  "I shall not return until I have
found it," were his parting words, "and it is of no use
your writing, for I am going to try to travel about."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Morton, therefore, did not know where to
write, and neither did he like to leave his delicate
wife to go in search of him when he heard from a
traveller that a gentleman like Gerald Morton had
been seen in the forest country north of Lake
Michigan.  But when she was dying, Mrs. Morton,
thinking of his dying mother's request, begged him
to go in search of his brother, and he had started
with Cyril for that purpose after her death.
</p>

<p>
Cyril then related his adventures.  Cynthy was
exceedingly interested in them all.  She had heard
of the trial of robbers at Menominee, when Whiterock
and his captain were condemned to death, and knew
what an immense amount of harm the band of
robbers had done.  It seemed to her a wonderful
thing that one of the band&mdash;Davidson&mdash;should have
repented and returned to a civilised life.  "You'll be
glad all your life that you helped him, Cyril," she
said in her hearty way, "and I hope, sir," she added
to Mr. Morton, "that when you have found Mr. Gerald
you will tell him.  He'll like to hear that."
</p>

<p>
Last thing that evening, just when they were all
endeavouring to persuade each other that they were
not at all hungry, because there was no food left,
they all at once heard a great knocking at the very
top of the outer door.
</p>

<p>
Who could it be?  It was beginning to get dark.
Was it the ghost?  Cyril asked the question half
laughingly, but he looked considerably startled.
When people have resigned themselves to the fact
that they are many miles away from any other
person, it is rather queer to find someone knocking
at the door.  It was Cynthy who cried out first,
"What do you want?  Who is there?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-119"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-119.jpg" alt="&quot;'What do you want?  Who is there?'&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;'What do you want?  Who is there?'&quot;
</p>

<p>
The others could not hear the answer, but it
evidently reassured her, for she gave a cry of joy,
and her eyes shone with delight as she again tried
to open the door, but in vain.  Then she turned to
explain to the others.  "It's my Harry," she said.
"He's found us.  I thought he would."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," sang out a hearty voice from the other
side of the door.  "No matter what difficulties
intervene love can find a way."
</p>

<p>
Cynthy blushed, and tried to hide her face from
her companions, but Mr. Morton reassured her by
kind words and a reminiscence of a far-off time when
the dear lady who became his wife was lost with
some others on a mountain, and he alone was able
to find her, because he persevered after the others
gave up the search.  All this time the man outside
was digging the snow away from the door.  As he
did so he called out, "Why, Cynthy, I hear you've
Mr. Gerald inside there.  'Tis his voice, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"No 'tisn't," returned she, "but it is his brother
and nephew, whom I came across in the snow some
little time before getting here."
</p>

<p>
"That's lucky," cried the man outside, "for I've
found out where Mr. Gerald is!"
</p>

<p>
They were all very glad to hear that, and when at
length the snow was cleared off sufficiently to admit a
fine, tall young man they besieged him with questions.
</p>

<p>
Harry Quilter related with much pleasure, as he
shook hands with Mr. Morton and Cyril, that a
hunter had informed him at which lumberer's camp
he had lately seen the missing man.  "It was only
about ten miles off as the bird might fly," he said,
which caused Cynthy to exclaim it would be nearly
double that distance if they rode there.
</p>

<p>
Harry then proceeded to empty his pockets, which
were stuffed with tea, dried deer-flesh, salt bacon,
and a great hunk of bread.  Asked how it was he
knew of the whereabouts of his young lady, he
answered that a trapper he had met had informed
him that he had seen a great quantity of smoke
issuing from the chimney of the haunted house.
It was impossible to believe that a mere ghost could
have lighted a fire so large as to cause all that
smoke, and as Harry was anxious about the
non-appearance of Cynthy Wood at her home he had
put on his moccasins and plodded through the snow.
He had brought as much food as he could carry,
in case there should be a difficulty about returning
that night.
</p>

<p>
They would have been almost merry, as they sat
round the rough table enjoying the welcome food,
if it had not been for the thought of the tragedy
which had deprived that poor house of its owner,
and also the fact that Blackie was still calling out
for food, which made the tears come into his master's
eyes every now and then.  He would have taken
his own plate into the kitchen if Cynthy had not
forbidden it.
</p>

<p>
"You need support more than that fat pony of
yours does, Cyril," she said in her brisk way.  "But
here is some more lump sugar.  Now I can't spare
anything else.  Sugar is very feeding, you know."
</p>

<p>
"And Blackie loves it.  Thank you, Cynthy.  Oh,
just come and see my pony, will you, Mr. Harry?"
he added to the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"What!  Do you keep ponies in my house?"
cried a harsh voice behind them.
</p>

<p>
They all turned to look at the door, which had
silently opened.  In the doorway stood an old man,
with a hooked nose and long, neglected hair.  He
was so thin that he looked almost like a skeleton,
and he leaned heavily upon a strong, notched stick.
On his feet he wore moccasins, with which he had
been able to walk through the snow.
</p>

<p>
"Is it the ghost?" faltered Cyril, whose imagination
had been much exercised about the haunted house.
</p>

<p>
Cynthy did not smile; she looked at the figure
in the doorway with a pale, frightened face.  "It is
Mr. Jabez Jones," she faltered.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, it's Jabez Jones, at your service," said the
old man, coming forward.  "And he would like to
know what you are doing in his house, and what a
horse is doing in his kitchen?"  He almost screamed
the last words as Blackie neighed more loudly than
ever.
</p>

<p>
"We are travellers who have come here for shelter
from the snow," said Mr. Morton wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"And I've come in search of one of them," said
Harry Quilter, finding his voice at length.  "You
know me, Jabez Jones, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, and I know her," said the old man,
pointing to Cynthy, "but I don't know these," looking
at the Mortons.  "However, never mind.  I guess
I'll have a cup o' yon tea."
</p>

<p>
"Take my place," said Harry, offering his
three-legged stool.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I'll ha' my own arm-chair," said the old
man rudely.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Morton at once rose, and placed it for him
with gentle courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't be a ghost, for you're just old
Jabez and no one else!" cried Cynthy.  "But everyone
thinks you were drowned in the river six months
ago," she added.  "Do tell us how you escaped."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't drowned," said the old man.  "But who
has been after my money?"  He put down the cup
he was just raising to his lips and went up to the
hole in the floor to investigate it, chuckling as he
did so.
</p>

<p>
Cynthy, reassured that it was really Jabez Jones
in life exactly as he had ever been, described to
him the scene that she and Cyril witnessed on their
arrival at the house, which the old man heard with
grunts of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"So Pete has begun to repent!" he said.  "I'm
glad of that.  And see now, my money isn't here
after all.  I took it away to the bank at Menominee
last fall, and when I got out of the river&mdash;for I was
able to float in it until washed on shore miles away
lower down&mdash;having some gold with me, I just went
across country to Menominee to see if it was safe.
Happening to read in a newspaper that I had been
killed, and my house was haunted, I thought I'd
stay away a bit and frighten my graceless son well,
and let him seek the money in vain.  You see,
everyone thought I kept it hid in a hole somewhere,
because I always talked against banks, saying they
were the worst places in which a man could keep
his money.  But talking is one thing and doing's
another."  He returned to the table and drank his tea.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Morton shook his head sadly over the
hardened old man, and as the lovers sat together
in the chimney-corner, talking after tea, whilst
Cyril gave Blackie its lump sugar, he tried to
make him see that the love of money is a great
evil, and that in his case it had led his son into
sin.  But the old man's mental state was a very
dark and unenlightened one, and not much
impression could be made.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
<i>THE MEETING IN THE FOREST.</i>
</h3>

<p>
All through the winter the lumberers work
in the woods, from sunrise to sunset,
making the forest resound with the strokes
of their axes as they fell tree after tree in amazing
quantities.  Often they divide into bands of six or
eight men, each company striving to outrival the
other in the amount of work it gets through.  At
night they return to the great wooden shanty, in
which they sleep in the bunks arranged on two
tiers of wooden shelves all around the place.  They
eat salt pork and drink strong tea, and at night
sit round the huge log fires, smoking and chewing
tobacco, and sometimes singing and telling stories.
</p>

<p>
Men who are strong and used to physical exertion
enjoy the work, and return to it again and again, for
the wages are good, and the bold, free life out of
doors is not without its charms.  But Gerald Morton
was not strong enough, or yet rough enough, for the
labour and the company it entailed.  The men
perceived this, and did not like to work with him, in
spite of his pleasant, cheery ways.  They nicknamed
him "the gentleman," and at last their foreman was
obliged to admit that it would be well for him to
go to some other sphere of labour.
</p>

<p>
"You're not adapted to this life, nor yet strong
enough for it," he said to Gerald, "so you had better
go."
</p>

<p>
Gerald was thinking of these words as he spent his
last day in the woods at the lumbering.  On the
morrow he must again set out on the wearying
search for work.  He was no nearer finding a fortune
than on the first day of his life in America, but he
thanked God in his heart as he worked that he had
found in those huge American forests that which
was of more value than any earthly money.  Through
his head were ringing the words of an old, old Book,
which he carried everywhere with him, at first because
it was his mother's, and afterwards for its own sake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the
judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much
fine gold: sweeter also than honey, or the honeycomb.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>Moreover, by them is Thy servant warned: and in
keeping of them there is great reward.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Father!  Father!  That must be Uncle Gerald!
Look!  See!  He's just like your and Cynthy's
description of him!"
</p>

<p>
Cyril's glad cry caused the axe to drop from the
tired lumberer's hand.  He turned and saw a little
company of equestrians coming quickly up to him,
their horses crunching the hard snow and the broken
boughs strewing the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Gerald!  Gerald!  My dear Gerald!" cried Mr. Morton,
dismounting and holding out an eager hand.
</p>

<p>
"Cyril!  Cyril!"
</p>

<p>
Gerald clasped the hand as if he would never let
it go.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"We have both been lost in the backwoods, Uncle
Gerald," said Cyril, with a fine sense of comradeship,
as they returned home in a great Transatlantic
steamer.
</p>

<p>
"And you have both been found," said his father,
with deep thankfulness.  "My two beloved ones," he
added mentally, looking at them with glad eyes, as
he thought that neither would have been restored to
his friends if it had not been for his strenuous efforts
to do right and serve God when to do so was an
extremely difficult task.  "Truly there is a reward
for the righteous," he said to himself, and he was
not thinking merely of the earthly result of their
conduct.
</p>

THE END.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
